### Coding Rules for Rebel Origin Data {-}

I collect data on the origins of rebel groups. The information is drawn from a variety of sources including news articles, secondary sources such as conflict histories, and the Uppsala Conflict Data Program Encyclopedia. As it is often difficult to discern the origins of rank-and-file members, I code group origins on the basis of their leadership. Whatever social role the leaders of a rebel group had prior to their participation in the group constitutes its origin. If rebel leaders came from multiple backgrounds, I attempt to discern the largest source. However, if any rebel leaders came from another rebel organization, the group is coded as a splinter or alliance.

The categories of origin groups were derived inductively, so as to exhaustively capture all real world possibilities. The categories are meant to be descriptive, and allow for maximum flexibility rather than imposing a particular theoretical framework on the data. The categories are described below:

- **Splinter** These organizations emerge from pre-existing rebel groups, and differ from their predecessor in structure (i.e. a group that simply changes its name or objectives would not be coded as a new group). All groups coded as splinter organizations by UCDP are included here, as well as several others I identify. Most splinter organizations are factions of existing rebel groups that deliberately choose to break away and form a separate group (e.g. Red Flag faction of the Communist Party of Burma), though a few were expelled by the parent organization. Also included are groups that form from the remnants of rebel groups who were recently inactive due to defeat or demobilization, yet do not replicate the parent organization to such an extent as to be a direct continuation.

- **Alliance** These organizations are coalitions of two or more pre-existing violent groups. All groups coded by UCDP as alliances are placed in this category, as well as many other not identified by UCDP. Groups that were inactive for a period before the current round of fighting are considered alliances.

- **Militia** Militias are groups that are armed but have few or no political aims. In practice, this means groups that were previously violent, but do not appear in a UCDP conflict against the government. Most often these groups form to defend an ethnic group or community, but previously had no aims beyond that.

- **Regime Military Faction** Military factions are a portion of the state's armed forces acting against their own government without authorization. The vast majority of coup attempts derive from military factions, but a substantial number of sustained rebellions do as well. Military commanders who leave the government and recruit soldiers from outside the military are also included here. I consider cases where a government official uses government forces to challenge for control of the regime a coup, while a government official using non-governmental forces is a rebellion.

- **Civilian Government** These organizations have leadership who previously served in the government. In some cases the rank-and-file of these groups may come from the government as well, for instance if the police turn against the government. In other cases government leaders mobilize their party or other social connections to build a rebel group. Regional governments that initiate secessionist movements are also included here.

- **Political Party** Political parties are defined broadly here.
Any organization that has clear political aims but is not initially violent is included. Organizations that produce programmatic platforms and contest elections are unsurprisingly included. However, as many civil wars occur under regimes that are not particularly democratic, participation in elections is not a requisite for this category. Some groups attempt to run in elections and resort to arms after being barred from doing so. Others, including many Communist parties, have most of the attributes of a political party but turn violent without first attempting to work through non-violent channels. Neither is a broad platform required; special interest/advocacy groups focusing on a narrow set of issues are also included. However, single-issue organizations advocating secession are placed in a separate category.

- **Religious Organization** Organizations that primarily exist to promote a certain religion are coded as religious organizations. These differ from political parties with religious platforms in that they generally include clergy or individuals claiming religious authority in a less formal capacity, and running candidates in elections is at most a secondary consideration. The Muslim Brotherhood is an exemplar of this category.

- **Foreign Sponsorship** In a few cases rebel groups emerged through the actions of an outside state, rather than from an organization within a country. This category includes cases in which rebel elites received training in a foreign country, and cases where an outside government played the predominant role in organizing individuals into a rebel group.

- **Student Organization** Student organizations are relatively self-explanatory. They generally originate on university campuses, and draw a majority of their members from the student population.

- **Transnational Organization** Transnational organizations are non-state actors that originated in a different state, and played a crucial role in establishing the rebel group. In some cases this entails directly establishing a chapter of the organization in a new country, as is the case for al-Qaeda cells. This category also includes cases where fighters from one conflict move into a neighboring country and continue fighting there.

- **Economic Organization** These organizations originally existed for economic purposes, broadly defined. This primarily includes criminal organizations and labor unions.

- **Protests** A small number of rebel groups are not traceable to any pre-existing organization. Instead, they seem to be the result of protesters or rioters banding together to form a rebellion through a very organic process.
