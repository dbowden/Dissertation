## Repression and the Dynamics of Individual Attitudes

While the availability of existing organizations plays a large role in determining which ideologies and identities rebel entrepreneurs initially employ in recruiting members, the appeal of these bases of mobilization can change over time. I am particularly interested in changes in the extent to which individual dissidents orient towards sub-national identities such as ethnicity or religion,^[Subsequently, I focus primarily on ethnicity. I expect that ethnicity will be the most salient cleavage in a majority of societies, but in some cases religion or other identities may play this role.] which often provide a basis for division within the dissident movement, and more inclusive priorities such as a non-sectarian ideology. I expect that government repression will be a crucial determinant of this orientation.

### The Relative Cost of Fighting

One dissident attribute that can be altered by repression is the willingness to engage in violence. Participation in rebellion is largely a function of demographic traits, with impoverished young men accounting for a large portion of recruits [@Humphreys2008]. The role of poverty is thought to be related to opportunity costs - individuals with comfortable lifestyles are unlikely to take on the risks of fighting, while impoverished individuals have little to lose [@Collier2004]. The cost of participating in rebellion relative to non-violence is not necessarily static, however. Indiscriminate violence against civilians can reduce the the risk of participation in violence relative to that of non-violence, by making non-violence more dangerous and thus less desirable [@Kalyvas2007]. If the physical risk of remaining peaceful is not dramatically lower than that of fighting, the cost of participating in rebellion is relatively low.

Thus, individuals who experience repression, either personally or in close enough proximity to influence their expectations of safety, should become more willing to engage in violence. Individual thresholds for violence will continue to vary, meaning that some will continue to remain peaceful. Yet in general, the number of dissidents who are willing to engage in violence should increase with the risk of physical harm from repression. Furthermore, repression should aid in rebel recruiting and mobilization efforts. For example, some individuals may find the initial set of grievances voiced by a rebel group to be unpersuasive, but are moved to join the cause after witnessing government brutality.

### Ethnic Identity

Some theoretical perspectives view ethnic and other social identities as largely immutable, having been the basis for conflict across many generations [@horowitz85]. Increasingly, however, scholars view identity as a product of individual or collective choice. @Posner2005 argues that individuals choose to prioritize one of several identities such as ethnicity, language, religion, or class, selecting that which is likely to bring them the greatest benefit. Focusing on the realm of electoral politics, he finds that this choice is shaped by an interaction between group size and electoral institutions. In subsequent work @Eifert2010 find that individuals are more likely to identify with their ethnic group when interviewed near a competitive election, suggesting that ethnicity is deployed instrumentally during elections. @Penn2008 models a similar calculation in which individuals choose to orient themselves toward a national or ethnic identity. She finds that ethnic identities become more prevalent as ethnic groups become homogenous, and as economic inequality between ethnic groups increases. @Christia2012 extends the argument to civil wars, arguing that ethnic identities are deployed instrumentally, with rebel elites emphasizing particular identities to justify alignments that are in fact driven by power politics. A key consequence of this malleability of identity is that ethnic outbidding is not inevitable - if political actors can appeal to multiple, overlapping identities, competition is no longer zero-sum [@Chandra2005]. The opposite is also true, however - previously cooperative relationships can be undermined by enhancing the salience of ethnic identities.

I argue that violent repression should tend to increase the extent to which individuals identify with their ethnic group.^[Hereafter I will refer mainly to ethnicity as the primary alternative to broad identities. In some societies other social markers such as religion are likely to be more salient, but I expect these to operate in a similar manner to ethnicity.] A vast scholarly literature views ethnic identity as a cause of conflict [e.g. @horowitz85]. Several scholars have also considered the possibility of a causal relationship running in the opposite direction, with conflict influencing individual identity. The bulk of this work argues that external threats such as interstate war can promote the creation of national identities, facilitating statebuilding [@Herbst1990; @Tilly1992; @Gibler2012]. @Gibler2012 focus on territorial threat as the key driver of identity changes. As many territorial disputes are driven by irredentist logics (i.e. a state seeks to acquire territory that is home to ethnic groups prevalent within its own borders), citizens in the target state have a strong incentive to emphasize national identities to avoid the impression that they support the challenging state. @Herbst1990 [122] similarly sees interstate war as a crucial source of nationalism, arguing that "...people realize in a profound manner that they are under threat because of who they are as a nation; they are forced to recognize that it is only as a nation that they can successfully defeat the threat."

Others have speculated that an opposite process may occur in civil wars, whereby individuals become more oriented toward ethnic identities. @Kaufmann1996 argues that in conflicts where ethnicity is the primary dividing line, individuals will experience a security dilemma in which their survival is increasingly tied to the success of their group. However, this does not explain why ethnicity would become the basis for conflict in the first place. @Kuran1998 offers an explanation for this, arguing that "ethnic activists" can provoke a cascade of increased ethnic identification, particularly when they use violence on behalf of the ethnic group. He explains,

>"Ethnic violence, along with the ensuing reactions, repression, and counter-violence, creates ethnic grievances, and it revives memories of past sufferings. Often, therefore, it makes people of all ethnic groups turn inward as a precaution against further violence," [@Kuran1998, 46].

Often repression is applied in a manner with the potential to highlight ethnic identities. Distinguishing dissidents from pro-government or neutral individuals is generally quite difficult [@Kalyvas2006]. If detailed knowledge about particular individuals is unavailable, governments may adopt crude solutions to this problem, assuming that particular social groups or locales are generally sympathetic to the opposition. If individuals are targeted on the basis of their ethnicity, ethnic identities should become more salient. This in turn should trigger the linked fate mechanism described by @Kuran1998. Under these conditions, individuals should tend to see banding together with co-ethnics as their best chance of survival. By contrast, it may be difficult to trust members of other ethnic groups not to defect to the government side.

Ethnic groups may also have logistical tools that make ethnic identification instrumentally rational. Many ethnic groups, especially in the kinds of societies where significant ethnic discrimination occurs, have political parties or nationalist organizations that might be useful for launching a rebellion. In countries that have previously experienced ethnic conflict, there are sometimes ethnic militias^[I distinguish militias from rebel groups as the former tend to be small, localized, and have few political ambitions. Instead they generally exist to protect a specific group, locale, or economic activity.] that can be converted into larger, more political rebel groups. Outside states also frequently contribute material support to co-ethnic rebel groups [@Cederman2009]. Compared to most bases on which rebellion could be built, ethnicity tends to offer a significant head start in terms of organizing members and acquiring resources. Thus, individuals facing repression should often turn to ethnicity as a means to organizing resistance.

Thus far, this discussion has focused on the responses of dissident civilians. Rank-and-file rebels have a very different experience during conflict. These individuals are likely to be targeted by repression (or worse) regardless of whether it is applied on the basis of ethnicity. Yet, increased ethnic identification among constituents can extend to rebels through two mechanisms. First, these individuals can demand a rebel group that represents them on more explicitly ethnic terms. This might be especially likely if dissidents feel that existing rebel groups have failed to adequately protect them from the government. As I discuss in more detail in the section below on "Group Formation," repression can lead previously non-violent individuals to take up arms, in some cases leading to the direct creation of new rebel groups. Second, rebels themselves may begin to identify more strongly with their ethnic group through their connections with family and friends who experience repression. As members see their own communities come under threat, they are likely to become less supportive of broad or abstract goals, and more supportive of efforts to defend particular groups or locales. As discussed in the section on "Splintering" below, these members may break away to form a new rebel group that places greater emphasis on ethnicity. They may also use the threat of doing so to induce existing groups to embrace ethnic identities.

### Government Agency

Thus far, I have treated repression as an exogenous influence on dissidents. In reality, the government is almost certainly a strategic actor, with its use of repression being endogenous to its expectation of how dissidents will respond. Governments might be more inclined to repress if they expect that doing so will sow division among their opponents. Alternatively, dissident pools that are already divided might make more attractive targets for repression than unified ones. It is important to account for such possibilities both theoretically and empirically. This is would be particularly true if my expectation that repression often produces fragmentation among dissidents is borne out, as it is not entirely clear whether this would be a desirable outcome for the government. Furthermore, if repression does in fact increase the number dissidents willing to resort violence, its use by governments becomes downright puzzling.

One explanation is that influencing the size or structure of rebel groups is not the only, and perhaps not even the primary purpose of repression in most cases. First, the governmental institutions involved in fighting rebels may differ from those that conduct the bulk of repression. Whereas civil wars tend to be conducted by state militaries, repression is often conducted by police forces or outsourced to pro-government militias, with less-than-perfect coordination between the entities [@Mitchell2014]. Second, rebellion is not always a particularly grave threat to a government's survival. Indeed, only about 16% of rebel groups defeat the government [@Cunningham2009]. By contrast, leaders routinely lose power through elections, and are sometimes forced to resign in the face of mass uprisings. If governments use repression to maximize their chances at political survival, deterring dissidents from voting or protesting may take priority over preventing or dividing rebel movements. In either case, the government's strategy of repression would not be (entirely) endogenous to its affect on rebel structure.

Another explanation is that repression may operate largely through a deterrent effect [@Pierskalla2010]. The true target of repression, then, is not the individuals who experience violence, but rather those who observe such actions. Thus while the individuals who are actually repressed may become more likely to use violence, it is possible that many others will lower their willingness to use violence in order to avoid such a fate. In this case the government would essentially be accepting the presence of a small number of very committed dissidents in exchange for an aggregate reduction in the number of people willing to fight. @Lichbach1987 suggests such a possibility, as he argues that while repression tends to increase dissident violence, its affect on the total level of dissident activity is dependent on whether it mixes repression with policy concessions.

In some cases, however, repression is likely aimed at least partially at making rebellion more difficult. If, as I predict, repression reduces the cost of fighting and increases the willingness of its targets to participate in violence, the government's use of this tactic remains a puzzle. One explanation is that repression is a sort of gamble. At its most successful, repression might induce dissidents to flee the country and become refugees, deter violent mobilization by signaling resolve [@Pierskalla2010], or physically prevent collective action from occurring. The possibility of such a desirable outcome might lead governments to repress, even if doing so brings some risk of an escalating cycle of repression and increasingly violent dissent. As governments likely have incomplete information about their own ability to identify and repress dissidents, and about dissident resolve, counterproductive uses of repression are conceivable. Another possibility is that at least to a certain point, the unity of the rebel movement matters more to governments than its size. Governments in this case would be accepting an increased number of rebels in exchange for the benefits of a divide-and-conquer strategy. Lastly, repression appears to be the default response to unrest across the spectrum of regime types. Indeed, @Davenport2007b finds that states almost invariably meet challenges to the status with repression, describing the pattern as "the law of coercive responsiveness." Thus, it may be the case that states simply repress unless a significant feedback leads them to revise their strategy. In this case, governments likely would not consider the potential negative consequences until after a significant amount of repression had been applied.

A more complete consideration of the government's use of repression is beyond the scope of this project. As the preceding section demonstrates, there are a number of theoretical accounts in which the structure of the dissident movement is incidental to the decision to repress.

### Non-Governmental Sources of Repression

To this point I have generally assumed that the government is the primary source of repression. In reality, this is not always true. Both rebels and their constituents may face violence from other rebel groups, outside states, or less political non-state actors such as militias or criminal organizations. In general I do not expect that the source of repression makes much difference for the process described above. If the risk of violence from any source increases, an individual's relative cost of participating in rebellion should decrease. As is the case with governments, some rebel groups and militias are clearly associated with particular ethnic groups and/or choose their targets for victimization on the basis of ethnicity. Repression in these cases should tend to increase ethnic identification, just as it would if it were applied by the government.

### Testing the Microfoundations

The preceding account suggests two testable propositions about individual-level attitudes, which I evaluate in Chapter \@ref(survey-chapter). First, I follow @Kalyvas2007 in arguing that violent repression should reduce the relative cost of participation in violence. This implies that individuals who have personally been repressed^[The survey data I use (the Afrobarometer survey) only asks individuals whether they have been attacked, without specifying the attacking party.] should on average exhibit a greater willingness to engage in violence than individuals who lack such experiences.

*Hypothesis 1: Individuals who experience repression should be more willing to participate in political violence themselves*

Additionally, I expect that repression will tend to induce its targets to identify more strongly with their ethnic group^[In some cases a group type other than ethnicity, such as religion or clan might be more salient than ethnicity. However, my survey data asks only about ethnic identification.], as repression is often applied disproportionately to certain groups, increasing the salience of such identities. Furthermore, ethnic identification may have instrumental value as ethnicity is often a particularly useful basis on which to organize responses to repression.

*Hypothesis 2: Repression should increase the extent to which an individual identifies with their ethnic group*
