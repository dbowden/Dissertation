Why are civil conflicts sometimes contested by multiple rebel factions, while in other cases by a single, cohesive group? At a given point in time, I argue that it is the choice of ideologies and identities around which rebellions mobilize that determines whether they incorporate most of the dissidents in a society, or whether many dissidents are left to form their own groups. These arrangements are often fragile, however, as factors such as government repression can lead dissidents to become more receptive to new bases of organization. Drawing on the literature reviewed in Chapter 1, I identify three processes through which these individual dynamics shape the number of rebel groups in a civil war. First, entirely new groups can enter the conflict. Second, previously cohesive groups can splinter into multiple successor organizations. Finally, previously independent groups sometimes merge. In the remainder of this chapter I articulate a set of assumptions, a theory of the internal politics of dissident movements, and a set of hypotheses to be tested in subsequent chapters.

## Theoretical Framework

I begin by laying out my assumptions about the relevant actors in a civil war, their interests, and the structure of their interactions.

### The Dissident Pool

I start from the assumption that rebel groups are drawn from a broader pool of dissidents. By dissident, I simply mean an individual who opposes the government. Dissidents are grouped into a variety of potentially overlapping organizations. Some may belong to non-violent political organizations such as trade unions or political parties. Others may use violence as members of a rebel group. Hereafter I "rebel movement" as a term that encompasses all rebel groups, but excludes non-violent dissidents. In some cases this rebel movement will consist of a single group, if there is only one rebel organization associated with the dissident pool. In the American Civil War, for example, the dissidents were represented by a single Confederate Army, though even in this case there were several militias with only a loose attachment to the main rebel group. In other cases the rebel movement may contain several distinct rebel groups, such as the Shan State conflict in Burma, which has produced at least six rebel groups.

At the individual level, dissidents are likely to vary on several dimensions. First, individuals differ in their level of involvement in violence. @Lichbach1995 [17] identifies five gradations of participation which range from being constituents who may not even consent to being represented by the dissident movement, to activists who engage in political activity but not necessarily violence, to militants who participate in violence or work in close support of such efforts. For instance, civilian activists may provide crucial material and logistical support to rebels [see @Weinstein2007; @Parkinson2013c]. Relatedly, dissidents may utilize different "repertoires of contention" [@Tilly1986; @Tilly2006], perhaps reflecting the resources and past behavior of the groups through which they are mobilized. For example, some elements of the dissident pool might specialize in non-violent actions such as boycott, others on conventional political channels such as elections, while others in engage in violence. In addition to varying across individuals, the willingness to use violence is often dynamic --- previously violent individuals often desert their rebel group, and previously non-violent individuals can be moved to participate in the fighting.

Social identities form a second dimension of variation among dissidents. A few dissident movements are exceptionally homogenous. For example, some separatist movements benefit from a coincidence of ethnicity, language, religion, and geographic location. In most cases, however, there is some amount of diversity along these attributes. For example, the Kurds share a common ethnicity and language, but practice a variety of faiths. Bids to overthrow the central government might be made by coalitions featuring representatives of multiple ethnic groups, religions, languages, and regions. Rebel leaders often emphasize broad, inclusive goals and identities, hoping to gain the support of a large portion of society. Such coalitions are often vulnerable to "outbidding appeals" [@Rabushka1972; @horowitz85], through which moderate, diverse groups lose support to competitors claiming to explicitly represent a particular identity group.

Finally, while dissidents share a common interest in removing the incumbent government, they do not necessarily agree on many other political questions. Rural dissidents might make land reform their top priority in a post-war government, whereas urban dissidents might care more about corruption or modernization programs. Some dissidents hope to take control of the central government, as the Houthi rebels have done in Yemen, while others hope to procure independence or greater regional autonomy as a consequence of the war, as the South Sudanese eventually did. Broader left-right ideological divisions are often present, and doctrinal differences often divide groups with relatively similar views. For example, Indian communists were long divided into Maoist and Marxist-Leninist factions. Even when dissidents largely agree on goals, there are likely to be divisions between hardliners and moderates, who will be more willing to accept compromises and less willing to adopt extreme tactics. Finally, even dissidents who largely agree on questions of policy will still find themselves in competition over the power and private benefits of government [@Christia2012], which are subject to rival consumption. There are a limited number of government positions, and material benefits such as oil rents are finite.

Beyond these variations in preferences, I see three key categories of dissident.

#### Dissident Constituents {-}

I label dissidents who do not participate in violence, but support violent efforts to some extent as "dissident constituents." These constituents may support rebels in a variety of ways, including the provision of food, shelter, and information. This constituency is also likely to be a vital source of recruits for rebel groups. In cases where rebel groups are associated with a political party, these constituents will be a critical source of electoral support. Constituents have limited agency with respect to the array of rebel groups they can choose to support. Yet while rebel groups are sometimes able to coerce support, constituents generally have some ability to withhold support. For example, constituents could turn on a rebel group by becoming government informants [@Kalyvas2007]. Alternatively, constituents could flee an area and become refugees or internally displaced persons. Thus, while they tend to have little-or-no direct influence over rebel groups, rebel leaders nonetheless have incentives to be responsive to the interests of constituents.

The most fundamental interest held by dissident constituents during civil war is likely to be security. These are individuals who have elected not to participate in violence themselves. Avoiding violence is thus likely to be a high priority for them, leading them to value rebel groups that can provide protection or steer the fighting away from civilian areas. Secondary to this, dissidents are likely to have political preferences they would prefer to see represented by a rebel group. For example, in addition to opposing the incumbent regime constituents might like to see improved status for their ethnic group or land reform. If the rebel group a constituent currently supports does not have a platform that aligns closely to their interests and succeeds in providing protection, they should be receptive to appeals from other groups.

#### Rank-and-File Rebels {-}

Rebel groups are generally hierarchical organizations, with the majority of members having little influence over their direction. I call the rebel group members who do not occupy leadership positions "rank-and-file rebels." Much like constituents, rank-and-file rebels have limited input in group decisions, but have what @Hirschman1970 calls the "exit" option. If members are sufficiently dissatisfied with the direction of a rebel group, they generally can leave to form a new splinter organization, or desert the conflict entirely. As losing a substantial number of members could devastate the fighting capacity of a group, rebel elites again have an incentive to be at least somewhat responsive to their members.

Individuals who join rebel groups often (though not always) do so out of deep commitment to a political cause [@Humphreys2008]. Thus one dimension over which rank-and-file members is political action. If group leaders stray too far from their original platform, or are insufficiently forceful in advocating for it, they are likely to face internal dissent from rank-and-file. Rank-and-file members also tend to have connections to civilian family members and friends. Thus they are likely to support efforts to protect and oppose efforts to abuse civilians, at least from social groups with whom they share a connection. Failure to represent the interests of these rank-and-file members puts rebel leaders at significant risk of losing members through splintering or desertion.

#### Rebel Entrepreneurs {-}

Finally, I call the dissident elites who lead existing rebel groups and form new ones "rebel entrepreneurs." I assume that rebel groups generally emerge through the efforts of these entrepreneurs, rather than, say, the spontaneous organization of protesters. Leading a rebel group is likely to be attractive for several reasons. First, leaders exercise significant, and sometimes total control over a rebel group's political platform. Even if a rebel group does not defeat the government, rebel entrepreneurs may be able to secure concessions on a few of their favored issues in post-war peace negotiations. Rebel elites also frequently receive significant private benefits. During conflicts, rebel groups sometimes acquire control of natural resource production, or illicit trades such as drugs. While some of these funds are used to attract and retain rank-and-file soldiers, rebel elites often reap a significant amount of profit.

Maintain political leverage and control of private resources requires a reasonably strong rebel group. As these political and material benefits are often even more plentiful for rebel leaders who defeat the government, they should generally prefer to build a rebel group strong enough to win. Thus in general, leaders of existing rebel groups should elect to be responsive enough to rank-and-file members and constituents to prevent significant losses in members. At the same time, as some portion of the private benefits are often distributed to rank-and-file members, rebel leaders should seek minimum winning coalitions, rather than endlessly pursuing more power [@Christia2012]. Thus rebel leaders may be willing to tolerate some loss of support, placing on constraint on the extent to which they are accountable to members. 

Rebel entrepreneurs who do not currently lead their own rebel group should look for opportunities to do so. This might entail forming a new rebel group, by appealing to dissident constituents with a different platform than existing rebel groups offer, or by leading a group of rank-and-file members in the creation of splinter organizations.

#### Changes to the Dissident Pool {-}

I generally treat the dissident pool as a fixed set of government opponents. In reality, however, it will often change in size over the course of the conflict. Throughout history civilians have often fled conflict in large numbers to become refugees. While one might reason that dissidents are somewhat less likely to do this than neutral civilians, in many conflicts the dissident pool is undoubtedly depleted by fleeing members. Successful counterinsurgency operations by the government or third parties can also reduce the ranks of the dissidents. Both rebels and non-violent dissidents are often killed in great numbers, and even when they are not, they may be subjected to imprisonment or repression that makes mobilization difficult. Under certain conditions, dissidents may even defect to the government side [@Staniland2012d]. In Iraq, for example, a 2007 counterinsurgency campaign by the Iraqi government and U.S. forces persuaded many previously dissident Sunni militias to join the government's fight against al-Qaeda.

In other cases the dissident pool may grow. Government repression may induce previously neutral civilians to support the opposition. Dissidents may attract support by offering a morally or politically superior platform to the government's, or by obtaining legitimacy through their choice of tactics or international support [@Chenoweth2011]. Rebels may attract new supporters by demonstrating strength and by extension their prospects for success [@Christia2012], or by offering private benefits to recruits [@Weinstein2007]. Rebel groups may also attract or coerce support from civilians by controlling territory [@Mampilly2011]. Finally, dissidents may be bolstered by international support. The Islamic State has recruited young Muslims from around the world to join them in Syria. At a less violent level, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam enjoyed significant financial support from the Tamil diaspora, effectively giving them a larger civilian support network than they had locally.

While I am primarily interested in changes to the structure of the dissident movement independent of its size, it is important to consider the possibility that the dissident pool may change in composition as well.

### The Formation of Rebel Groups

One school of thought in the literature on the causes of civil war argues that rebellion is motivated primarily by the pursuit of private benefits such as oil rents or profits from illicit trades [@mueller00; @Collier2004]. This so-called "greed hypothesis" implies that rebels are not necessarily insistent upon defeating the government. While doing so may be desirable in some cases if control of the state brings significant revenue streams, often rebels aspire only to preserve their control of revenue from sources such as drug cultivation. For example, the RUF in Sierra Leone controlled several diamond mines through much of the civil war there, procuring significant wealth for themselves and their external sponsors. @Kalyvas2006 similarly believes that rebel violence is often motivated by private concerns, though he sees personal animosities such as the Hatfield-McCoy rivalry in the US as a more common priority than material wealth.

I depart from the greed school and follow @Lichbach1995 and @Weinstein2007 in viewing private benefits such as drug revenues as a recruiting tool and secondary benefit of rebellion, rather than as ends in themselves. The ultimate goal of rebel groups, then, are political outcomes such as the overthrow of the central government, or autonomy for a particular region. Thus, all else equal, rebel groups should prefer to defeat the government militarily. Short of that, they should prefer to use gains on the battlefield to secure at least a portion of their political goals in a postwar peace agreement. This creates an incentive for rebel leaders to amass as much military and political power as possible. Yet, even as a secondary motive, private benefits create a countervailing incentive to limit the size of one's group, so as to maximize the share of benefits distributed to each member. Ultimately, then, rebels should seek to build minimum winning coalitions just strong enough to win the war [@Christia2012].

I conceptualize rebellion as emerging from the efforts of rebel entrepreneurs, who seek to recruit fellow dissidents to participate in violence. There are several challenges inherent to such a task. First, persuading individuals to participate in collective action is generally difficult, and especially so in the high-risk context of rebellion. Second, rebellions generally need to build capacity quickly, to ensure that they can survive government repression. Indeed, @Lewis2016 finds that many rebel groups fail within a few months. Third, achieving political goals typically requires a cohesive rebel group that is able to avoid infighting and splintering [@Staniland2014]. Finally, rebel entrepreneurs should prefer to organize groups on a basis that allows them to exclude some segments of the population from receiving private benefits [@Christia2012].

I expect that drawing on existing organizations such as political parties, religious organizations, student groups, or labor unions will solve many of these problems. Social networks with members who expect to interact in the future can often solve collective action problems by sanctioning individuals who decline to participate [@Marwell1988]. Many civil society organizations will produce such ties among members. For example, members of a teachers' union might expect to interact throughout their career, as would most members of a political organization representing the interest of a particular geographic area. Drawing from existing groups also offers the possibility of mobilizing a large number of people quickly, particularly if rebel entrepreneurs can gain the support of group leadership. Existing social organizations can also produce a cohesive rebel group, particularly if they have strong vertical ties between leadership and rank-and-file members, and strong horizontal ties between chapters or geographic areas, as this allows the central leadership to exert a high degree of command and control over members [@Staniland2014]. Finally, building a movement by recruiting existing groups will often allow rebel entrepreneurs some control over group size, whereas recruiting individuals may not.

Consistent with these notions, my own data collection^[I begin with the set of all rebel groups in the Uppsala Armed Conflict data, 1946--2015 [@Melander2016]. I code the primary origin of each rebel group by examining the social roles its leaders had prior to forming the group. The coding rules for each category are described in the Appendix.] shows that most rebel groups can trace their origins to a pre-existing organization such as a political party, militia, or student organization [see also @Staniland2014]. Comparatively few have emerged through grassroots processes, such as protesters steadily becoming more violent and organized 
(see Figure \@ref(fig:origplot)).

```

The implication of this argument is that initially, at least, the structure of rebel movements will reflect the structure of pre-war civil society. If a single organization connects most or all dissidents in a country, it may be possible for dissidents to build a unified group on that basis. For instance in a two-party system most regime opponents might share common membership in the opposition party. When no such unifying organization exists, the probability that multiple rebel groups will emerge is much higher. This argument also implies that the choice of basis on which entrepreneurs attempt to organize rebellions will be endogenous to the degree of prior organization around said bases. For example, in much of the Middle East freedom of assembly is granted only to religious organizations, meaning that religious identity is likely to form the basis of rebellions there, while ideological or occupational identities are unlikely to do so.

@Staniland2014 shows that the structure of these pre-existing organizations is a powerful determinant of the subsequent cohesiveness of the rebel groups they produce. Groups that have both strong vertical ties between leaders and members, and strong horizontal ties across different units prove to be very cohesive. Many of the organizations that spawn rebellion lack this attribute, however, meaning that in many cases division among members can lead rebel groups to splinter. @Staniland2014 also suggests that these social ties can be dynamic. Thus while the attributes of the originating organization shape those of the rebel group initially, it is possible for the social ties to strengthen or weaken over time. For example, repeated interactions may facilitate the formation of alliances between previously independent factions. Alternatively, certain counterinsurgency strategies, such as targeting individuals who serve as key social "bridges," might sow division within previously cohesive groups.

### The Role of Individual Preferences

I argue that rebel structure is shaped by a bottom-up process in which the preferences of rank-and-file members and civilian constituents play a crucial role. Translating individual-level preferences to group-level outcomes is not straightforward, however. Logically, the properties of one level of analysis cannot directly explain outcomes at a higher level [@Singer1961]. It is thus necessary for a bottom-up theory to specify how lower-level preferences aggregate. I argue that rebel leaders have strong incentives to be responsive to their members, though the mechanisms producing this incentive vary by group.

Some rebel organizations are integrated with political structures that provide some degree of democratic accountability. Hamas, Hezbollah, the Irish Republican Army, and the Karen National Union, to name but a few, have political wings that are often equal to or above the militant side of the group in the organizational hierarchy. In many cases these political wings compete in elections, creating a strong incentive to behave in a manner that is popular among a large portion of the population. The past behavior of the group's armed wing should often be an important consideration for voters, especially during periods of intense fighting. For example, Hamas' victory over Fatah in the 2006 Palestinian elections may be attributable in part to the latter's inability to end Israeli campaigns against Palestinian territories [@Zweiri2006]. Rebel groups with this sort of connection to electoral politics should thus have an incentive to respond to the preferences of their constituents.

While rebel groups that lack a political wing may not be directly accountable to sympathetic civilians, they still have strong incentives to retain the favor of their members. Absent any connections to a civilian political structure, rebel groups are by definition fundamentally militarized organizations. As such, they tend to be very hierarchical in structure, and therefore undemocratic.^[Some notable exceptions do exist. al-Qaeda, for example, lacks a political wing and yet has a deliberately decentralized, flat structure with local cells following only loose direction from the central leadership.] Yet, the ability to directly voice concerns to leadership is not the only way for rank-and-file rebels to exert influence in an organization. In general dissatisfied individuals also have the ability to exit an organization [@Hirschman1970]. This is especially true in the context of rebel organization, as rebels frequently break away from their group to form new splinter organizations [see @Pearlman2011]. While some rebel groups may be built upon sufficiently dense social networks to prevent such fragmentation [@Staniland2014], in many cases rebels should be able to demand accountability from their leaders by threatening to leave the group. This effect may be exacerbated by the presence of rival entrepreneurs promoting new groups built around differing ideologies or identities. Civilian constituents may also have exit options. While I expect that rebel groups usually emerge from existing social organizations, individuals often have several overlapping affiliations. If, for example, they are dissatisfied with the performance of a rebel group associated with their religion, they may be another rebellion associated with their political party that they could support instead.

As these individual-level preferences are translated to rebel group leaders through an informal mechanism, I do not expect the decision rules that determine when leaders will respond to members, and which preferences are represented when members disagree, are especially complex. Rather, leaders will respond in a way that simply minimizes the loss of membership. If group members disagree on an issue, leaders will follow a plurality rule, representing the preference of the largest group subset. If group members are divided on the question of accepting support from an outside state, for example, leaders are likely to side with the largest constituency. Leaders can adjust their ideologies, and sometimes even their religions. For example, many former Ba'ath Party officials in Saddam Hussein's Iraq moved from the secular ideology of that movement to become pious devotees of Sunni Islam in order to assume leadership roles in the Islamic State [@McCants2015]. There are limits to the extent to which leaders can accommodate their members, however. While ideologies can be adjusted, leaders likely cannot claim to represent an ethnic group of which they are not members. There may also be limits to how far a leader can move their ideology or identity without losing credibility. Finally, some member demands may be materially impossible to meet, such as a demand for payment in a group that lacks any revenue streams.

In short, I expect that rebel leaders have a strong incentive to be responsive to their members. When they fail to do so, or when members make demands that cannot be met, a reorganization of the rebel movement is likely.
