## Processes of Structural Change

These individual-level dynamics produce changes in the overarching structure of the rebel movement through three processes. First, they can drive the formation of entirely new rebel groups. Second, they can lead individuals who already belong to a rebel group to break away into splinter organizations. Finally, they can facilitate the creation of alliances among previously independent groups.

### Group Formation

By "group formation" I mean the entry of entirely new groups to the conflict. I define a group as new if it did not originate as a faction of another rebel group. A rebel group that draws its leadership and members from a political party that did not previously engage in violence would constitute a new group if it were to take up arms. I would consider a faction of an existing rebel group that breaks away to form its own organization to be a splinter organization, discussed in the following section. At a minimum, group formation requires that two conditions be met. First, previously non-violent individuals must change their mobilizational calculus. This entails either participation in violence becoming more attractive, or remaining non-violent becoming less attractive.

Second, there must be a division among the dissident constituents. Newly mobilizing individuals must have a reason for forming a new group rather than joining an existing one. At their most benign, these divisions might simply reflect the difficulty of coordinating actions across physical distance or linguistic barriers. For example, dissidents on opposite sides of a mountain range might choose to form independent organizations. In such cases the formation of multiple rebel groups might be a matter of convenience rather than an indicator of animosity or divergent objectives. In other cases, however, divisions may be deeper and more difficult to reconcile. For instance, if some rebels make improving the status of their ethnic group a primary concern, it is unlikely that members of other ethnic groups will join their organization, and any existing members with differing ethnic identities will be likely to leave.

As noted in the preceding discussion of individual-level dynamics, repression can satisfy both of these conditions. The application to the first condition requires little explanation. Repression should reduce the relative cost of fighting, as non-violence brings fewer assurances of safety. Thus, the pool of individuals willing to participate in violence should expand with the level of repression. The crucial question, then, is whether they join existing rebel groups, or form new ones. I argue that these new dissidents will often choose the latter. First, if significant numbers of civilians have been repressed, they may place some of the blame on existing rebel groups. If civilians provide material support to a rebel group, they may expect protection in return. Being repressed would be a strong indication that the rebel group is failing in this role. Alternatively, they may blame existing rebels for provoking the government into repressing. In either case, they are likely to hold negative affect toward existing groups.

I also expect that beyond changing the cost of fighting, repression should make individuals more inclined to emphasize sub-national identities such as ethnicity. Unless there are already rebel groups placing strong emphasis on ethnicity, a new group may be more able to appeal to these identities. A rebel group that previously emphasized a non-sectarian ideological agenda, or drew support from a multi-ethnic coalition, will have difficulty credibly pivoting to an emphasis on a particular ethnic identity. Recall that I assume there is an ever-present set of rebel entrepreneurs seeking opportunities to build new groups of their own. These entrepreneurs should often be able to propose a new rebel group that makes ethnicity more central to its identity than previous organizations. The literature on ethnic outbidding suggests that these efforts should often be successful. Outbidding is a dynamic in which leaders make progressively more extreme proposals in hopes of winning the support of the group [@Rabushka1972; @horowitz85]. Key to these models are the assumptions that individuals identify with a single ethnic group, that they care only about ethnic issues, and that ethnic politics is a zero-sum game. This produces a completely polarized bargaining space in which individuals choose ideal points at which their group's interests are represented fully (e.g. a preference for a legislature in which group members hold a majority). In a spatial model of voting with such  parameters, the optimal strategy for politicians is to adopt the most extreme position possible [@Rabushka1972]. In Sri Lanka, for example, parties representing the Sinhala majority proposed increasingly discriminatory policies against the Tamil minority [@horowitz85]. Even if a multi-ethnic coalition forms initially by creating uncertainty as to which group will be advantaged, it will eventually be undercut by challengers making more extreme appeals to a single ethnic group. Other bases of mobilization, by contrast, tend to produce more heterogeneous preferences - some members will actually prefer moderate positions - and thus greater potential for compromise. While the original formulation of the outbidding model assumes competition in an electoral context, it has also been shown to more violent forms of competition such as terrorism [@Kydd2006; @Chenoweth2010; but see @Findley2012a]. Thus as individual dissidents become more oriented toward ethnic identities, rebel groups making extreme bids should tend to attract more new members than moderate groups.

While this process should initially re-orient a subset of dissidents around the ethnic identities that are targeted with repression, the mobilization of one group can lead to similar behavior in others, even if the latter groups do not experience repression themselves. @Kuran1998 shows that ethnic identification is interdependent, meaning that if some members of society begin to emphasize ethnic identity more strongly, the probability that others will do so increases. Increased mobilization around one ethnicity can also pose a threat to members of other ethnic groups, leading them to mobilize for reasons of self-defense [@Posen1993]. Perhaps for these reasons, several studies have found that contagion effects frequently cause a proliferation of both secessionist movements [@Ayres2000] and ethnic conflict [@Lane2016].

I thus expect that repression will tend to ultimately lead to the formation of new rebel groups. A set of individuals who did not fight previously will be motivated to enter the conflict. Rather than joining existing rebel groups, however, these individuals will often look to form new ones. Repression should induce greater levels of ethnic identification, which will tend to make existing non-sectarian rebel groups unattractive relative to new, more explicitly ethnic groups.

From this argument I derive three testable hypotheses. First, the probability that a new rebel group will form should be highest when the level of repression in a country is highest.

*Hypothesis 3: The probability that a new rebel group will form should increase with the level of repression in the country*

Second, the ability of repression to create new rebel groups should be moderated by the number of ethnic identities available for mobilization. If a country has high levels of repression, but low ethnic diversity, we should not expect the mechanism elaborated above to produce new rebel groups. This effect should be captured by an interaction between repression and ethnic diversity. I expect that when ethnic diversity is low, the effect of repression on the probability of new rebel groups should be low, as there are few ethnic groups available for activation. When diversity is high, however, the effect of repression should be large.

*Hypothesis 4: There should be a positive interaction between repression and ethnic diversity*

Finally, if the mechanism through which repression produces new rebels is in fact the activation of ethnic identities, we should expect to see this reflected in the characteristics of the new rebel groups. Specifically, the newly-formed groups should be especially likely to draw their support from a single ethnic group.

*Hypothesis 5: Rebel groups that join ongoing conflicts should be more likely than others to draw their support from a single ethnic group*

### Splintering

I define a splinter organization as a new rebel group that was previously incorporated into a larger rebel group. Whereas group formation is a phenomenon driven by dissidents who did not previously engage in violence, splintering is driven by individuals who already belong to rebel groups. Often these splinter organizations are a relatively small subset of the original organization. For example, the Real Irish Republican Army was a subset of particularly hardline members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, who left their parent organization in protest of its participation in a ceasefire preceding the Good Friday Agreement. In other cases splinter organizations may eventually surpass their parent organization. The Islamic State originated as a regional chapter of al-Qaeda, but eventually outgrew its parent organization by pursuing a more aggressive recruiting strategy.

While rebels are generally more likely than constituents to experience violence, they are likely to be targeted for being militants, rather than for belonging to particular ethnic group. Thus, violence will often not have a direct effect on the identity of rebel group members. Yet, rebels and especially rebel entrepreneurs should respond to changes in the preferences of dissident constituents. As discussed above, the leaders of a successful rebellion are likely to accrue a variety of private benefits. They will typically exert substantial control over post-war political and policy outcomes, and may have opportunities to skim profits from the state. Even before the war ends, rebel leaders often enrich themselves through the control of natural resources or illicit trades [@Collier2004]. Thus, enterprising dissidents should look for opportunities to gain control of their own rebel group.

Shifts in the identities of dissident constituents might offer such an opportunity. Civilian support networks can be a key source of material resources and logistical support for rebel groups [@Weinstein2007; @Parkinson2013c]. If a new rebel faction could win over a substantial number of dissident constituents, their chances of building a competitive organization would be significantly greater than they would in the absence of such resources. A shift among dissidents toward greater ethnic identification creates the possibility that a new group could win their support through an outbidding appeal, as discussed above. Civilians who are facing violence are quite likely to prefer a rebel group that can offer protection. If these civilians increasingly see the conflict in ethnic terms, a rebel group making an explicit claim to represent their ethnic group is likely to be more credible than groups lacking such a connection. Thus, rebels who see members of their ethnic group being repressed should have an incentive to break away from their existing organization and create a more explicitly ethnic splinter organization.

Many rank-and-file rebels should be receptive to these new organizations as well. Although repression may not directly influence the identity of individuals who have already rebelled, these individuals may ultimately increase their orientation as well if they see their family members, friends, or home communities repressed on the basis of ethnicity. These rank-and-file members will likely wish to make protection of family members and constituents a greater priority in response to repression. An explicitly ethnic rebel group may be able to commit to this more forcefully than an organization with a diverse coalition, or a non-sectarian political agenda.

Similar to group formation, I expect that repression will induce greater ethnic identification among dissident constituents. Entrepreneurial rebel elites should respond to this change in attempt to attract the support of these constituents. For entrepreneurs who do not already lead a rebel groups, this is likely to entail forming a new splinter organization.

*Hypothesis 6: The probability that rebels groups splinter should increase with the level of repression in a country*

The mechanism proposed above assumes that pre-existing rebel groups are vulnerable to outbidding appeals because they are either multi-ethnic, or organized on a basis that does not emphasize ethnicity. If the original rebel group is strongly associated with a single ethnicity, however, it should be less likely to experience splintering.

*Hypothesis 7: Multi-ethnic rebel groups should be at greater risk of splintering than mono-ethnic ones*

Finally, this theory implies that splintering is done to create more explicitly ethnic rebel groups. Thus, I expect that splinter organizations should be more likely than groups that form though other means to be associated with a single ethnic group.

*Hypothesis 8: Splinter organizations should be more likely than others to draw their support from a single ethnic group*


### Alliance Formation

Both group formation and splintering can increase the number of rebel groups active in a conflict. This number can decrease, however, when rebel groups form alliances. I define an alliance as substantial integration of capabilities and command by two or more previously active, independent rebel groups. Typically these alliances will result in the creation of a named umbrella organization to coordinate battlefield operations. For example, the Syrian Democratic Forces coordinates the actions of several Kurdish and Arabic forces in their fight against the Islamic State. Note that this definition entails a deeper level of integration than most alliances between states. I choose to focus on this category for two reasons. First, named umbrella organizations are easily identifiable, whereas less comprehensive cooperative arrangements are often not well-publicized, as rebels lack formalized processes such as treaties for creating them, and may have incentives to hide such cooperation from the government. Second, mergers of this sort have a meaningful effect on the complexity of civil wars, as rebel groups often channel most or all of their activities through umbrella groups. Less formal alliances, by contrast, are often short-lived, and may entail a more circumscribed form of cooperation, such as a non-aggression pact. 

I expect that alliance formation is driven by a similar underlying dynamic to splintering --- as dissident constituents shift their identities and preferences, the rebel movement should change in structure to reflect these contours. While the increased levels of ethnic identification resulting from repression can lead existing rebel groups to splinter, they can also facilitate the formation of alliances among co-ethnic rebel groups. Ideological, religious, or other differences that might have previously inhibited collaboration between some rebel groups will become relatively less important as ethnicity increases in salience. Thus, repression can open new opportunities for ethnically-homogeneous alliances. These alliances could be valuable for several reasons.

First, one major drawback of splintering is that it tends to produce a new group that initially, at least, has less material capability than did the original organization. Alliances can offset these losses, as one of their primary effects is the aggregation and coordination of capabilities. This is perhaps the most common conception of alliances in international politics [see @Bennett1997], and it has been proposed as a motive for rebel alliances as well [@Bapat2012; @Horowitz2013]. The logic of capability aggregation differs somewhat between international and civil conflicts, however. Whereas international alliances aggregate capabilities by bringing states into a conflict in which they might not otherwise participate, rebel groups by definition are already participating in conflict. Nevertheless, these alliances can bring great value because rather than simply aggregating, they can concentrate capabilities in space and time. For example, two rebel groups might be unable to capture a government-held town on their own, but in a joint operation would be sufficiently powerful to do so.

Second, alliances can allow also for burden-sharing and specialization. Burden-sharing has been offered as an explanation for international alliances such as NATO [@Sandler1980], though it may not occur under all circumstances [see @Olson1966]. Alliances can ensure that a single rebel group is not responsible for defeating the government, and might serve as a mechanism for reigning in the temptation to free ride off of another group's efforts. Relatedly, alliances can facilitate specialization by rebel groups. For instance, one alliance partner might specialize in holding territory, while another specializes in launching offensives in new areas. Furthermore, they can share strategies and technical information. For example, Hamas is believed to have learned how to use suicide bombings through its alliance with Hezbollah [@Horowitz2013].

Third, alliances can manage conflict between members and ensure that their resources are directed toward common enemies. @Weitsman1997 argues that alliances often serve to tether powerful states to one another, so as to reduce the probability of conflict between them. @Gibler1996 finds that alliance treaties are often used to settle territorial disputes between the signatories. Similar alliances can be seen in civil wars, for example as a number of Syrian rebel groups agreed to focus their efforts in different regions of the country. This allows rebels to avoid conflict with each other. Compliance with such agreements is incentivized by the fact that reneging on the territorial arrangement would likely result in the loss of the other benefits of the alliance, such as capability aggregation.

Fourth, operating as an alliance bloc may be beneficial to the members groups in bargaining situations. An alliance with a set of coordinated demands might command greater bargaining leverage than individual members, who collectively have similar power, but a more disparate set of demands. Perhaps more crucially, alliances might mitigate credible commitment problems. Peaceful settlements to conflicts can be derailed by concerns that the other side will not adhere to the agreement [@fearon95]. In civil wars, this is often borne out by extreme "spoiler" factions. A rebel commitment to a peace agreement is more likely to be viewed as credible if it has formal control over other factions.

While the benefits are often many, most alliances between rebel groups are not without cost. The post-war political outcome, whether it comes in the form of a rebel victory or a compromise with the incumbent government, is likely to be shaped by all factions within the winning coalition. Thus, allying with another group holding differing ideologies and interests will tend to force a rebel faction to compromise on at least some issues, or to de-emphasize certain priorities. If, as I assume, rebels are motivated by political goals, the value of an alliance will decrease as its ideological similarity to its alliance partners decreases [@Bapat2012]. Furthermore, any private benefits deriving from the conflict outcome (such as seats in a post-war legistlature) must be divided among the members of the winning alliance [@Christia2012]. These concerns should tend to constrain the value of alliances in civil war. The existing literature finds that these concerns limit the size of rebel coalitions [@Christia2012]. Logically, they should also shape the choice of partners with whom rebels ally.

I do not expect that repression will directly affect the willingness of rebel groups to form alliances. If alliances are intended to aggregate or coordinate capabilities, external factors such as rebel strength relative to the government, or battlefield events should be the primary influences on the attractiveness of alliances. The experience of civilians should affect these calculations only insofar as they alter the level of resources available to rebel groups. I do, however, expect that repression will influence the choice of alliance partners, as it leads the rebel movement to reorganize around ethnicity. Alliances with co-ethnic rebel have the benefits of aggregating capabilities and managing conflict among members. As rebel interests increasingly become tied to ethnicity, partnerships between co-ethnic rebel groups should avoid the cost of agenda dilution [see @Christia2012; @Bapat2012]. Relatedly, ideological and other differences that might normally inhibit cooperation will become less important following a wave of repression. Thus, I expect that repression should tend to increase the incidence of ethnically-homogeneous alliances.

*Hypothesis 9: The probability that new mono-ethnic alliances will form should increase with the level of repression*

Partnerships with rebel groups of differing ethnicities should become less attractive, however, as these could undermine a rebel group's claims to represent its ethnic group, and leave it vulnerable to outbidding appeals. At the same time, factors that might otherwise serve as a unifying force such as shared ideology should decline in relative importance, and ethnic differences should become harder to overcome when pursuing alliances. Repression should thus make rebel leaders disinclined to enter into multi-ethnic alliances.

*Hypothesis 10: The probability that new multi-ethnic alliances will form should decrease with the level of repression*

I provide comprehensive tests of these hypotheses in the following three chapters.
