# Theory Revisions

## Preference Aggregation

- Rank-and-file members have preferences
- Rebel groups generally aren't very democratic. No voice option.
    - Rebel groups drawn from political parties might be an exception.
- Members often do have an exit option, however.
- Rebel leaders are constrained by this possibility. Will tend to adopt positions that minimize losses. If most members come from a specific ethnic group, they are likely to represent that identity. For non-zero sum issues, there will be logrolling. More diverse groups are less likely to adtop ethnic identities - more likely to attempt to preserve group with non-sectarian focus.
- Plurality rule
- Two variables - portion of the group a platform will retain, probability of working

## Downstream Implications of Coming from Groups

- Difficulty in merging structures in alliances (see Staniland)
- Type of organization influences ability to leave
