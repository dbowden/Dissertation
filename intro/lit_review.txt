## Previous Work on the Organization of Rebellion

The existing literature and empirical record suggest that the number of rebel groups active in a conflict is shaped by three broad processes. New groups can emerge when previously non-violent individuals mobilize and join the conflict. Alternatively, previously cohesive rebel groups can splinter into multiple successor organizations. Finally, the number of rebel groups can decrease when previously independent factions form alliances. I summarize the literature on each process in turn, and relate my contributions to the existing work.

### Group Formation

Around 30% of conflicts have at least one rebel group that was neither active from its beginning, nor did it split from an existing rebel group. Thus, the formation of new rebel groups during ongoing conflicts is an important determinant of rebel movement structure. Yet few studies directly consider this phenomenon. Even studies of civil war onset often leave the formation of rebel groups in a black box, instead making a leap from individual motives to war initiation. For instance, a large literature views rebellion as an essentially criminal activity, driven by greed [@mueller00; @Collier2004; @Lujala2005]. Yet these works generally have very little to say about the origins of rebel organizations. These groups could be pre-existing criminal organizations that initiate more violent activity in hopes of securing greater profit, they could form for the purpose of a greed-driven rebellion after a sign of weakness from the government, or they could begin as rebel groups with sincere political goals, which are later seduced into less noble pursuits. The grievance school similarly tends to neglect group formation. For example, @Cederman2010 offer a nuanced explanation of the conditions under which ethnic minorities are likely to rebel. Yet, they say little about the logistics of organizing a rebellion, and seemingly assume that ethnic groups have an inherent ability to spawn rebel organizations.

Scholars working at lower levels of analysis have come closer to explaining group formation. @Kalyvas2006 suggests that individuals are often already mobilized for small-scale violence such as personal rivalry, criminal activity, or ethnic conflict. Building a rebel group is thus an exercise in building coalitions from small, pre-existing organizations, and re-orienting individuals from localized issues to national-level political cleavages. Kalyvas gives little attention to this process in his empirical analyses, however, instead recommending it as an area for future research. @Staniland2014 also argues that most rebel groups can trace their origins to pre-existing social organizations, though he sees larger, and often more political entities such as political parties or military units as the primary source of rebellion, rather than the localized and less formal groups emphasized by @Kalyvas2006. @Staniland2014 focuses primarily on linking the attributes of the originating organizations to rebel group outcomes such as durability, however, and does not give much consideration to the initial formation of these groups. @Lewis2016 provides one of the few studies that does explicitly consider rebel group formation, as she carefully documents the earliest activities of rebel groups in Uganda. She finds that rebel groups, including the Lord's Resistance Army, were typically founded by small number of entrepreneurial individuals, and initially tended to value stealth over broad mobilization. Only after the conflict began to escalate did groups seek to broaden their membership, in many cases by appealing to particular ethnic groups. Thus she sees scholars such as @Cederman2010 and @Staniland2014 as beginning their analyses after rebellion had existed for some time.

Also of relevance to group formation is the substantial literature on the contagion of civil war. @Gleditsch2007 finds that transnational ethnic groups and political and economic linkages between states can provide channels for civil war to spread across international boundaries. Most of his cases, however, are pre-existing rebel groups moving into new geographic areas, rather than instances of *sui generis* group formation. Other scholars find that entirely new rebel organizations can emerge through the contagion of secessionist [@Ayres2000] and ethnic [@Lane2016] conflict. Such transnational processes might shape opportunities for multiple rebellions to emerge by increasing the availability of weapons, spreading tactical knowledge, or diverting government attention to foreign conflicts. While contagion explains an important category of phenomena, these studies are primarily concerned with the spread of conflict to previously peaceful areas, and do not necessarily explain the phenomenon of new groups joining ongoing conflicts.

### Splintering

Another process affecting rebel movement structure is the splintering of existing organizations. In 1968, for example, a faction led by Ahmed Jibril broke away from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) to form a new group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC). While the two groups have often collaborated against Israel, they maintain distinct organizational structures and membership bases, and operate in different areas. The split was allegedly motivated by differing views of Marxist ideology and military doctrine, with the PFLP pursuing a more extreme strategy of attrition. Similar splits have occurred within dozens of rebel groups, including the Communist Party of Burma, the Free Syrian Army and the Sudan Liberation Army. In many cases the result is more than a nominal separation. In Sri Lanka, for example, the Tamil Peoples Liberation Tigers not only split from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, but also defected to the government's side in the conflict [@Staniland2012d].

Compared to group formation, there is a relatively large literature on rebel group splintering. One subset of this research focuses on the role of external actors, and particularly the government. For instance, @McLauchlin2012 find that government repression provides occasion for groups to evaluate their current leadership structure. Pre-existing divisions within groups are likely to be exacerbated, leading the group to move toward more factionalized leadership structures. When group members are satisfied, however, conflict tends to lead to even greater unity and centralization of authority. Whereas the preceding studies essentially treat government repression as exogenous to the internal politics of dissident groups, @Bhavnani2011 present evidence that governments deliberately stoke tensions among their opponents, as they find that the Israeli government increased conflict between Fatah and Hamas by undermining Hamas' control of the Gaza and by tolerating Fatah's relationship with the Jordanian military. Relatedly, @Tamm2016 finds that support from outside states can alter the balance of power within rebel groups, in some cases entrenching existing hierarchies, while in others creating possibilities for fragmentation or coups. Finally, @Staniland2012d finds that the government can sometimes attract rebel groups to their side by offering greater resources during periods of infighting among rebel groups.

Another group of scholars emphasizes concerns about post-conflict bargaining as the key determinant of dissident group cohesion. @Christia2012 assumes that the winning coalition in a civil war receives private benefits, which might include any rents available to the state, and having some portion of its interests represented in the new government. Thus, rebels have an incentive to form minimum winning coalitions, so as to limit the number of coalition partners with whom they must share benefits. @Wolford develop a similar logic, theorizing that political factions have an interest in joining conflicts in hopes of maximizing the likelihood that their preferences will be represented in the post-war government. The value of fighting decreases, however, as the number of parties with whom they expect to share power increases. Yet, @Christia2012 suggests that this incentive to minimize coalition size is moderated by the risk of being outside the winning coalition, as there is a strong possibility of new waves of violence between victorious rebels and rival rebel factions. She thus expects coalitions to change frequently in response to battlefield events, with factions bandwagoning with battle winners and shifting away from losing coalitions. @Findley2012 similarly find fragmentation to be most common among groups that have recently lost battles. This implies that fragmentation is essentially a process of weak actors becoming weaker.

A final category of explanations places the source of rebel group cohesion in underlying social structure. @Staniland2014 argues that insurgent organizations will be most stable when their central leadership is able to exercise both vertical control over its rank-and-file members, and horizontal control over its constituent groups. This is most likely to occur when insurgencies draw from existing organizations with extant social ties of this sort, which might include former anti-colonial movements or ethnic political parties. Organizations are likely to fragment when constituent groups have a high degree of autonomy or control over individual members is limited [@Staniland2014, Ch. 2-3]. @Asal2012 emphasize similar factors, arguing that organizations with factionalized leadership structures are at risk of fragmentation, while groups with more consolidated power structures will tend to remain cohesive. Finally, @Warren2015 suggest that group size plays an important role, as small groups are able to police themselves and resolve conflicts, whereas larger groups are more likely to experience infighting.

### Alliance Formation

Whereas the formation of new groups and splintering can increase the complexity of a civil war, the number of rebel groups can also be reduced through the formation of alliances. Many of the most successful rebel movements in history were coalitions of formerly independent organizations. For example, the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional (FMLN) was an umbrella organization uniting several left wing rebel groups in El Salvador, which eventually secured many concessions in the post-war peace process including a place as a major political party. Surprisingly, however, alliances among non-state actors have only recently begun to receive much scholarly attention.

@Asal2008 and @Horowitz2013 conduct network analyses of alliance formation among terrorist groups, arguing that such arrangement are used to aggregate capabilities and share tactics. Much of the other work in the field focuses on the downsides of alliance. @Bapat2012 assume that alliances carry two significant costs: the dilution of each constituent group's agenda, and the risk of having one's private information sold to the government by an ally. Consistent with this theory, they find alliances to be most common when an outside state can enforce agreements, and when all rebel groups involved are strong enough to avoid the temptation of defecting to the government side. @Christia2012 similarly emphasizes capability, arguing that neorealist balancing theory from international relations explains alignments in civil wars. When one coalition - a group of rebels or government-aligned forces - becomes too powerful, other groups will band together to prevent their own destruction. But similar to @Bapat2012, @Christia2012 argues that this mechanism is constrained by a desire to maximize one's share of the post-war spoils. Thus, rebels should realign frequently, seeking to form minimum winning coalitions. While shared identity appears on the surface to be an important determinant of rebel alignments, Christia views these narratives as post-hoc justifications aimed at legitimizing decisions that are really driven mostly by power.

### Repression

As repression is central to the theoretical argument presented here, this dissertation is shaped by the literature on the topic. The focus in the existing work has been on explaining why repression occurs, and identifying factors that might prevent it. @Davenport2007a finds that there is a "domestic democratic peace," meaning that democratic regimes tend to refrain from using the most violent forms of repression. However, he finds that even democracies often engage in repression during civil and international conflicts. Others find that international human rights treaties often have a meaningful restraining effect on governments, reducing their use of repression [@Hathaway2002; @simmons09]. Not all international influences are positive, however, as economic sanctions [@Wood2008a] are associated with increased repression. An important generalization in the context of this study is that human rights practices tend to be shaped by domestic and international political institutions that are likely to be largely exogenous to civil war dynamics.^[Long-running civil wars, however, might deter democratization and participation in human rights treaties.] Another strand of the repression literature focuses on the consequences of repression, and especially the potential of repression to provoke escalation. In this vein @Lichbach1987 argues that repression should lead dissidents to substitute increasingly violent tactics for more peaceful ones, as they will calculate that violence is more likely to achieve their goals. @Moore1998 finds empirical support for this model, suggesting that repression has significant potential to escalate political confrontations.

### Ethnic Identification

Ethnic identity is central to the theoretical mechanism in this dissertation, and has long been an area of deep interest to scholars of comparative politics. This work is often predicated on the assumption that identity is dynamic. At a minimum, individuals can choose which of their several social roles to emphasize. For instance, individuals might orient primarily toward an ethnicity, a religion, an occupation, a region, or an ideology, and could potentially alter these choices over time. The majority of the work in this vein has focused on oscillations between ethnic and national identities. Early on this question was explored in the context of statebuilding. Scholars in this area suggest that external threats such as interstate wars [@Herbst1990; @Tilly1992] or territorial disputes [@Gibler2012] can provide a unifying influence, leading individuals to orient toward national identities and away from subnational ones such as ethnicity. Most other work in the area examines the role of political institutions in incentivizing the use of particular identities [@Posner2005; @Penn2008]. For example, @Eifert2010 find that ethnic identification tends to be strongest just prior to or just after competitive elections, suggesting that individuals interpret politics through an ethnic lens.

A striking feature of this literature is the degree of consensus that ethnic identity is malleable. This perspective is shared by a diverse range of scholars ranging from constructivists [e.g. @Barnett1995] to formal theorists [e.g. @Penn2008], and enjoys strong empirical support [e.g. @Eifert2010; @Gibler2012]. Thus, it provides a strong foundation on which to build my theory

### Rebel Motives

An examination of the relationships between dissident groups is also likely to offer a new perspective on rebel motives. The literature on civil war has largely been dominated by debates over whether rebellion is fundamentally political, or done in pursuit of private benefits. The former views civil war as an effort to resolve economic or political inequality [@gurr70; @Wood2003; @Cederman2010], and has been labeled as the 'grievance' hypothesis [@Collier2004]. The latter is composed primarily of studies emphasizing the 'greed' hypothesis [@Collier2004], which views rebellion as little more than large-scale criminal activity aimed at bringing profits to its members [@mueller00; @Lujala2005; @Ross2004e]. Others have emphasized non-material private benefits as motive for individual participation in rebellion, such as the ability to act on family disputes or romantic rivalries [@Kalyvas2006].

This political-private motive debate has yet to be definitively resolved. A number of scholars have found greater support for the greed hypothesis than for grievance, with the presence of natural resources being a stronger predictor of civil war than economic or political grievances [@Collier2004]. Yet, these findings are not robust across different types of resources or even different measures of the same resource [@Dixon2009a]. Furthermore, several scholars have found that political factors such as hierarchical relationships between ethnic groups [@Cederman2010] and poor economic performance [@Miguel2004a] exert a strong influence on civil war onset. Other scholars eschew the dichotomy altogether, suggesting that while private benefits are useful to rebel recruiting efforts, this does not preclude the possibility that rebel elites ultimately have political motives [@Lichbach1995; @Weinstein2007]. Similarly, @Lujala2010 finds that natural resources are associated with longer conflicts, implying that at least a portion of resource revenues are devoted to fighting rather than private benefits.

One factor that has limited progress on these questions of motive is the fact that the competing theories have been tested almost exclusively on a single outcome --- a binary measure of the occurrence of civil war at the national level. Studying the relationships between dissident groups and how they vary is likely to provide insight to underlying rebel motives. For instance, if rebellion is fundamentally about maximizing the profits of its members, we might expect to see rebels form the smallest coalitions possible that still allow them to control resource flows. If rebellion is fundamentally political, however, we might expect rebels to pursue coalitions large enough to pursue victory. Additionally, if ideology and identity are not truly important to rebels, splintering and alliance formation should be driven primarily by power calculations [see @Christia2012]. If these factors do matter, however, they should shape the choice of alliance partners and the cohesiveness of individual groups. Ethnically homogeneous rebel groups should be less prone to splintering in this case, and alliance should be more likely among groups with similar identities.
