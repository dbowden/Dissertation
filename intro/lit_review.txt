## Previous Work on the Structure of Rebel Movements

The existing literature and empirical record suggest that the number of rebel groups active in a conflict is shaped by three broad processes. The number of rebel groups can increase when existing groups splinter into multiple factions. New groups can also emerge when previously non-violent individuals mobilize and join the conflict. Finally, the number of rebel groups can decrease when previously independent factions form alliances. In the remainder of this chapter, I provide a definition of each process, and review the existing explanations for each.

### Splintering

Existing rebel groups frequently splinter into multiple successor organizations. In 1968, for example, a faction led by Ahmed Jibril broke away from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) to form a new group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC). While the two groups often collaborated against Israel, they maintain distinct organizational structures and membership bases, and operate in different areas. The split was allegedly motivated by differing views of Marxist ideology and military doctrine, with the PFLP pursuing a more extreme strategy of attrition. Similar splits have occurred within dozens of rebel groups, including the Communist Party of Burma, the Free Syrian Army and the Sudan Liberation Army. In many cases the result is more than a nominal separation. In Sri Lanka, for example, the Tamil Peoples Liberation Tigers not only split from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, but also defected to the government side in the conflict [@Staniland2012d].

A growing body of literature identifies several key determinants of rebel group splintering. One subset of this research focuses on the role of external actors, and particularly the government. For instance, @McLauchlin2012 find that government repression provides occasion for groups to evaluate their current leadership structure. Pre-existing divisions within groups are likely to be exacerbated, leading the group to move toward more factionalized leadership structures. When group members are satisfied, however, conflict tends to lead to even greater unity and centralization of authority. Whereas the preceding studies essentially treat government repression as exogenous to the internal politics of dissident groups, @Bhavnani2011 present evidence that governments deliberately stoke tensions among their opponents, as they find that the Israeli government increased conflict between Fatah and Hamas by undermining Hamas' control of the Gaza and by tolerating Fatah's relationship with the Jordanian military.

Another group of scholars emphasizes concerns about post-conflict bargaining as the key determinant of dissident group cohesion. @Christia2012 assumes that the winning coalition in a civil war receives private benefits, which might include any rents available to the state, and having some portion of its interests represented in the new government. Thus, rebels have an incentive to form minimum winning coalitions, so as to limit the number of coalition partners with whom they must share benefits. @Wolford develop a similar logic, theorizing that political factions have an interest in joining conflicts so as to maximize the likelihood of their preferences being represented in the post-war government, but the value of fighting decreases as the number of parties with whom they expect to share power increases. Yet, @Christia2012 suggests that this incentive to minimize coalition size is moderated by the risk of being outside the winning coalition, as there is a strong possibility of new waves of violence between victorious rebels and rival rebel factions. She thus expects coalitions to change frequently in response to battlefield events, with factions bandwagoning with battle winners and shifting away from losing coalitions. @Findley2012 similarly find fragmentation to be most common among groups that have recently lost battles. This implies that fragmentation is essentially a process of weak actors becoming weaker.

A final category of explanations places the source of rebel group cohesion in underlying social structure. @Staniland2014 argues that insurgent organizations will be most stable when their central leadership is able to exercise both vertical control over its rank-and-file members, and horizontal control over its constituent groups. This is most likely to occur when insurgencies draw from existing organizations with extant social ties of this sort, which might include former anti-colonial movements or ethnic political parties. Organizations are likely to fragment when constituent groups have a high degree of autonomy or control over individual members is limited [@Staniland2014, Ch. 2-3]. @Asal2012 emphasize similar factors, arguing that organizations with factionalized leadership structures are at risk of fragmentation, while groups with more consolidated power structures will tend to remain cohesive. Finally, @Warren2015 suggest that group size plays an important role, as small groups are able to police themselves and resolve conflicts, whereas larger groups are more likely to experience infighting.

Each of these studies makes an important contribution to our understanding of conflict complexity, and sheds light on the broader interests and organizational challenges present in rebel movements. Yet, while the fragmentation of existing groups accounts for a substantial portion of multi-rebel conflicts, other processes are at work in the majority of cases. Indeed, only 26.6%^[These figures are calculated using data on conflict participation from @Pettersson2015a and actor attributes from [@ucdpactor]. I code a conflict episode as a separate war if it occurs following at least two calendar years of inactivity. Secessionist movements are treated as separate conflicts from bids to overthrow the central government, and separate from each other if they concern different territories.] of the rebel groups that join ongoing civil wars splintered from an existing group, and only 9.7% are agglomerations of existing groups. Thus, nearly two-thirds of the groups that join conflicts^[The pattern is even more stark if one looks at conflict-years, as over 95\% of conflict years with multiple government-rebel dyads include at least one rebel group that is neither a splinter organization nor the source of one.] (only 20% of multi-dyadic conflicts have multiple rebel groups from the outset) do not appear to be the product of existing combatants reconfiguring, but rather are the result of an entirely new group of combatants entering the fray. I propose an integrated approach that accounts for both the fragmentation of existing groups, and the entry of new groups to the conflict.

### Alliance Formation

Several studies consider the formation of alliances among various types of militant organizations. @Asal2008 and @Horowitz2013 conduct network analyses of alliance formation among terrorist groups, arguing that such arrangement are used to aggregate capabilities and share tactics. @Bapat2012 model the logic of alliance formation among rebel groups. They assume that alliances carry two significant costs: the dilution of each constituent group's agenda, and the risk of having one's private information sold to the government by an ally. Consistent with this theory, they find alliances to be most common when an outside state can enforce agreements, and when all rebel groups involved are strong enough to avoid the temptation of defecting to the government side @Christia2012 similarly emphasizes capability, arguing that neorealist balancing theory from international relations explains alignments in civil wars. When one coalition - a group of rebels or government-aligned forces - becomes too powerful, other groups will band together to prevent their own destruction. But similar @Bapat2012, @Christia2012 argues that this mechanism is constrained by a desire to maximize one's share of the post-war spoils. Thus, rebels realign frequently, seeking to form minimum winning coalitions. While shared identity appears on the surface to be an important determinant of rebel alignments, Christia views these narratives as post-hoc justifications aimed at legitimizing decisions that are really driven mostly by power. Some important aspects of alliance formation are beyond the scope of the existing studies, however. Namely, while relative power considerations can potentially account for why rebel groups form alliances, and when they will alter their ties, it does not explain why groups choose a particular partner when multiple options are available. Christia suggests that these decisions are shaped by personal relationships between rebel elites, but does not give this question extended consideration in her empirical analysis. @Horowitz2013 find that militants prefer to ally with powerful groups, but their focus is largely on transnational networks of terrorists and insurgents, rather than alliance formation within a particular conflict. I seek to resolve this gap by explaining not only whether, but also with whom rebel groups will choose to form alliances.

### Mobilization

Few, if any, studies directly consider the phenomenon of new rebel groups joining ongoing conflicts. The literature on contagion is perhaps most relevant. @Gleditsch2007 finds that transnational ethnic groups and political and economic linkages between states can provide channels for civil war to spread across international boundaries. Other scholars find that secessionist [@Ayres2000] and ethnic [@Lane2016] conflict often spread through processes of contagion, with the rebellion of one group seemingly inspiring those in neighboring areas to take up arms themselves. Such transnational processes might shape opportunities for multiple rebellions to emerge by increasing the availability of weapons, spreading tactical knowledge, or diverting government attention to foreign conflicts. Similarly, transnational motives for conflict may come in the form of grievances becoming clearer and more salient in light of events in neighboring countries, as happened during the Arab Spring, or the expected probability of a successful rebellion shifting upward in response to nearby events. Yet, rebel groups that are themselves transnational, operating in multiple countries [see] @salehyan07] account for only 10.8% of conflict joiners.

## Broader Contributions

This project also contributes to a number of larger discussions in the civil war literature. Both the theoretical arguments and empirical results presented here shed new light on a number of ongoing questions.

### Rebel Motives

An examination of the relationships between dissident groups is also likely to offer a new perspective on rebel motives. For the last 15 years, the literature on civil war has largely been dominated by debates over whether rebellion is fundamentally political, or done in pursuit of private benefits. The former views civil war as an effort to resolve economic or political inequality [@gurr70; @Wood2003; @Cederman2010], and has been labeled as the 'grievance' hypothesis [@Collier2004]. The latter is composed primarily of studies emphasizing the 'greed' hypothesis [@Collier2004], which view rebellion as little more than large-scale criminal activity aimed at bringing profits to its members [@mueller00; @Lujala2005; @Ross2004e]. Others have emphasized non-material private benefits as motive for individual participation in rebellion, such as the ability to act on family disputes or romantic rivalries [@Kalyvas2006].

This political-private motive debate has yet to be definitively resolved. A number of scholars have found greater support for the greed hypothesis than for grievance, with the presence of natural resources being a stronger predictor of civil war than economic or political grievances [@Collier2004]. Yet, these findings are not robust across different types of resources or even different measures of the same resource [@Dixon2009a]. Furthermore, several scholars have found that political factors such as hierarchical relationships between ethnic groups [@Cederman2010] and poor economic performance [@Miguel2004a] exert a strong influence on civil war onset. Other scholars eschew the dichotomy altogether, suggesting that while private benefits are useful to rebel recruiting efforts, this does not preclude the possibility that rebel elites ultimately have political motives [@Lichbach1995; @Weinstein2007]. Similarly, @Lujala2010 finds that natural resources are associated with longer conflicts, implying that at least a portion of resource revenues are devoted to fighting rather than private benefits.

One factor that has limited progress on these questions of motive is the fact that the competing theories have been tested almost exclusively on a single outcome --- a binary measure of the occurrence of civil war at the national level. Studying the relationships between dissident groups and how they vary is likely to provide insight to underlying rebel motives. For instance, if rebellion is fundamentally about maximizing the profits of its members, the structure of rebel movements should be shaped largely by the natural resources present in a country. As many of the extraction of many of the resources thought to be associated with rebellion is not particularly labor-intensive (for instance, the extraction of alluvial diamonds from river beds), rebels should prefer to keep their groups small so as to maximize the share of profits given to each individual member. In resource-rich areas, we should see highly fragmented rebel movements. Furthermore, the use of violence in such a scenario is likely to be aimed at acquiring and defending access to resources, and if anything is more likely if other groups have adopted violent tactics. If rebellion is a political enterprise, by contrast, there should be possibilities for coalition building and cooperation between rebels, as the primary concern is maximizing the likelihood of defeating the government. Yet, there is also a possibility for free riding, suggesting the decision to resort to violence is interdependent in the direction of becoming less likely as other groups mobilize.
