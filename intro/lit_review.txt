## The Contribution of this Project

First and foremost, this project advances our understanding of a subset of civil wars that is crucially important for the reasons outlined above. This research explains three processes that account for most of the variation in the number of rebel groups in a conflict --- the entry of new groups, the splintering and mergers of existing ones. A few existing works examine the first and third processes individually. In the following section I discuss my contribution to those literatures. Broadly, I unify explanations of splintering and alliances into a more comprehensive theory of rebel movement structure than any previous work has done, and test my theory in a much wider empirical domain than prior work. With respect to the second process, this is among the first projects to directly address the phenomenon of new rebel groups joining ongoing conflicts. Existing work either considers the formation of new rebel groups (i.e. groups that were not previously contained within another violent organization) only in cases where it is coterminous with conflict initiation [e.g. @Lewis2016], or in the context of contagion into previously peaceful areas [e.g. @Lane2016]. Yet, I find that 27.5% of rebel groups active since World War II were neither present from the beginning of the conflict, nor is there any evidence that they descended from existing rebel groups. Another important contribution of this dissertation, then, is explaining this common but mostly ignored phenomenon.

Several important implications emerge in light of the theoretical mechanisms established here. One is that rebellion seems to be more political and more responsive to the preferences of rank-and-file dissidents than much of the existing literature would suggest. A substantial number of scholars view civil war as largely apolitical, instead being driven by material greed [@mueller00; @Collier2004] or personal animosities [@Kalyvas2006]. I argue that dissidents have strong preferences over the content of rebellion, and find that repression tends to induce stronger preferences for rebel groups that represent the interests of a particular ethnic group. While I cannot rule out the possibility that rebellions are initially driven by material considerations, as war initiation is beyond the scope of this study, my findings do suggest that civil war violence tends to have a politicizing effect over time. I discuss the literature on rebel motives in greater detail later in this chapter.

This work also suggests that governments can exert a powerful influence on the structure of dissident organizations, as repression can heighten the salience of identities that divide dissidents. This contrasts with the most existing accounts of rebel movement structure, which tend to focus on factors mostly internal to the rebel movement such as relative power among rebel factions [@Christia2012], or the strength of pre-war social ties among dissidents [@Staniland2014]. It also raises several interesting questions about government strategy in the face of dissent. My findings suggest that repression expands the pool of individuals willing to fight, which in a vacuum makes government repression puzzling. It is also unclear whether the other key consequence of repression I identify --- the increased salience of ethnic identity --- is a desirable outcome for the government. On one hand it could form the basis of an effective divide-and-conquer strategy. On the other hand, fighting multiple opponents could complicate the logistics of counterinsurgency, threaten the credibility of negotiated settlements, and undermine the prospects of a stable resolution to the conflict. While this calculation merits greater consideration that I am able to give it in this dissertation, my findings in Chapter \@ref(survey-chapter) suggest that repression may be aimed at deterring dissidents from political activities other than rebellion, such as voting.

In addition to resolving a gap in the scholarly literature, a better understanding of rebel movement structure is of value to policymakers. As noted above, conflicts with multiple rebel groups are among the most severe. Simply being able to predict which conflicts are likely to become severe through this mechanism has several useful applications. Policymakers might be able to identify early on the conflicts that are most likely to benefit from peace operations. Humanitarian organizations could predict which conflicts are likely to produce large numbers of refugees, and distribute resources accordingly. This work also be the possibility of moving beyond prediction and solving the underlying problem. As the empirical analyses identify the repression of civilians as a key mechanism driving conflict complexity, it stands to reason that protecting civilians might be an especially valuable undertaking for non-governmental organizations or outside states.

In the next section I situate my dissertation in the literature to which it is most closely related. I explain in greater detail my contributions over the existing work on rebel structure, and also discuss the implications of this work for the literatures on repression and ethnic identification.


## Previous Work on the Structure of Rebel Movements

The existing literature and empirical record suggest that the number of rebel groups active in a conflict is shaped by three broad processes. New groups can emerge when previously non-violent individuals mobilize and join the conflict. Alternatively, previously cohesive rebel groups can splinter into multiple successor organizations. Finally, the number of rebel groups can decrease when previously independent factions form alliances. I summarize the literature on each process in turn, and relate my contributions to the existing work.

### Group Formation

Around 30% of conflicts have at least one rebel group that was neither active from its beginning, nor did it split from an existing rebel group. Yet few studies directly consider the phenomenon of new rebel groups joining ongoing conflicts. Even studies of civil war onset often leave the formation of rebel groups in a black box, instead making a leap from individual motives to war initiation. For instance, a large literature views rebellion as an essentially criminal activity, driven by greed [@mueller00; @Collier2004; @Lujala2005]. Yet these works generally have very little to say about the origins of rebel organizations. These groups could be pre-existing criminal organizations that initiate more violent activity in hopes of securing greater profit, they could form for the purpose of a greed-driven rebellion after a sign of weakness from the government, or they could begin as rebel groups with sincere political goals, which are later seduced into less noble pursuits. The grievance school similarly tends to neglect group formation. For example, @Cederman2010 offer a nuanced explanation of the conditions under which ethnic minorities are likely to rebel. Yet, they say little about the logistics of organizing a rebellion, and seemingly assume that ethnic groups have an inherent ability to spawn rebel organizations.

Scholars working at lower levels of analysis have come closer to explaining group formation. @Kalyvas2006 suggests that individuals are often already mobilized for small-scale violence such as personal rivalry, criminal activity, or ethnic conflict. Building a rebel group is thus an exercise in building coalitions from small, pre-existing organizations, and re-orienting individuals from localized issues to national-level political cleavages. Kalyvas gives little attention to this process, however, instead recommending it as an area for future research. @Staniland2014 also argues that rebel groups can trace their origins to pre-existing social organizations, though he sees larger, and often more political entities such as political parties or military units as the primary source of rebellion, rather than the localized and less formal groups emphasized by @Kalyvas2006. @Staniland2014 too devotes relatively little space to rebel group formation, instead focusing on linking the attributes of the originating organizations to rebel group outcomes such as durability. @Lewis2016 offers a somewhat contrasting view as she carefully documents the earliest activities of rebel groups in Uganda. She finds that rebel groups, including the Lord's Resistance Army, were typically founded by small number of entrepreneurial individuals, and initially tended to value stealth over broad mobilization. Only after the conflict began to escalate did groups seek to broaden their membership, in many cases by appealing to particular ethnic groups. Thus she sees scholars such as @Cederman2010 and @Staniland2014 as beginning their analyses after rebellion had existed for some time.

There is also a substantial literature on the contagion of civil war. For example, @Gleditsch2007 finds that transnational ethnic groups and political and economic linkages between states can provide channels for civil war to spread across international boundaries. Most of his cases, however, are pre-existing rebel groups moving into new geographic areas, rather than *sui generis* group formation. Other scholars find that entirely new rebel organizations can emerge through the contagion of secessionist [@Ayres2000] and ethnic [@Lane2016] conflict. Such transnational processes might shape opportunities for multiple rebellions to emerge by increasing the availability of weapons, spreading tactical knowledge, or diverting government attention to foreign conflicts. While contagion explains an important category of phenomena, these studies are primarily concerned with the spread of conflict to previously peaceful areas. This overlaps only partly with the scope of this project; I am also concerned with the emergence of new rebel groups in areas already experiencing conflict.

In short, surprisingly few studies have given much consideration to the formation of rebel groups. The few that do [e.g. @Lewis2016] focus entirely on groups whose origins coincide with war onset. While research on contagion effects sheds light on the expansion of conflict, it does not address the entry of new groups to existing conflict zones. I seek to resolve this gap.

### Splintering

Existing rebel groups frequently splinter into multiple successor organizations. In 1968, for example, a faction led by Ahmed Jibril broke away from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) to form a new group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC). While the two groups often collaborated against Israel, they maintain distinct organizational structures and membership bases, and operate in different areas. The split was allegedly motivated by differing views of Marxist ideology and military doctrine, with the PFLP pursuing a more extreme strategy of attrition. Similar splits have occurred within dozens of rebel groups, including the Communist Party of Burma, the Free Syrian Army and the Sudan Liberation Army. In many cases the result is more than a nominal separation. In Sri Lanka, for example, the Tamil Peoples Liberation Tigers not only split from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, but also defected to the government side in the conflict [@Staniland2012d].

Compared to group formation, there is a relatively large literature on rebel group splintering. One subset of this research focuses on the role of external actors, and particularly the government. For instance, @McLauchlin2012 find that government repression provides occasion for groups to evaluate their current leadership structure. Pre-existing divisions within groups are likely to be exacerbated, leading the group to move toward more factionalized leadership structures. When group members are satisfied, however, conflict tends to lead to even greater unity and centralization of authority. Whereas the preceding studies essentially treat government repression as exogenous to the internal politics of dissident groups, @Bhavnani2011 present evidence that governments deliberately stoke tensions among their opponents, as they find that the Israeli government increased conflict between Fatah and Hamas by undermining Hamas' control of the Gaza and by tolerating Fatah's relationship with the Jordanian military. @Tamm2016 finds that support from outside states can alter the balance of power within rebel groups, in some cases entrenching existing hierarchies, while in others creating possibilities for fragmentation or coups. Finally, @Staniland2012d finds that the government can sometimes attract rebel groups to their side by offering greater resources during periods of infighting among rebel groups.

Another group of scholars emphasizes concerns about post-conflict bargaining as the key determinant of dissident group cohesion. @Christia2012 assumes that the winning coalition in a civil war receives private benefits, which might include any rents available to the state, and having some portion of its interests represented in the new government. Thus, rebels have an incentive to form minimum winning coalitions, so as to limit the number of coalition partners with whom they must share benefits. @Wolford develop a similar logic, theorizing that political factions have an interest in joining conflicts so as to maximize the likelihood of their preferences being represented in the post-war government, but the value of fighting decreases as the number of parties with whom they expect to share power increases. Yet, @Christia2012 suggests that this incentive to minimize coalition size is moderated by the risk of being outside the winning coalition, as there is a strong possibility of new waves of violence between victorious rebels and rival rebel factions. She thus expects coalitions to change frequently in response to battlefield events, with factions bandwagoning with battle winners and shifting away from losing coalitions. @Findley2012 similarly find fragmentation to be most common among groups that have recently lost battles. This implies that fragmentation is essentially a process of weak actors becoming weaker.

A final category of explanations places the source of rebel group cohesion in underlying social structure. @Staniland2014 argues that insurgent organizations will be most stable when their central leadership is able to exercise both vertical control over its rank-and-file members, and horizontal control over its constituent groups. This is most likely to occur when insurgencies draw from existing organizations with extant social ties of this sort, which might include former anti-colonial movements or ethnic political parties. Organizations are likely to fragment when constituent groups have a high degree of autonomy or control over individual members is limited [@Staniland2014, Ch. 2-3]. @Asal2012 emphasize similar factors, arguing that organizations with factionalized leadership structures are at risk of fragmentation, while groups with more consolidated power structures will tend to remain cohesive. Finally, @Warren2015 suggest that group size plays an important role, as small groups are able to police themselves and resolve conflicts, whereas larger groups are more likely to experience infighting.

The existing work in this field tends to feature impressive data collection or fieldwork, and makes important contributions to our understanding of rebel group cohesion. Yet, making predictions from existing approaches tends to require detailed information about a rebel group and its internal workings, which is difficult to acquire, particularly while a conflict is still active. Furthermore, this literature tends to be somewhat disconnected from work on other rebel attributes and behaviors, including alliance formation. This dissertation addresses these limitations by unifying the formation of new groups, splintering, and alliance formation under a single theoretical framework which relies on explanatory factors that are relatively easy to observe, allowing for predictions about rebel group structure even during conflicts.

### Alliance Formation

Empirically, alliances among rebel groups are both common and noteworthy. Many of the most successful rebel movements in history were coalitions of formerly independent organizations. For example, the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional (FMLN) was an umbrella organization uniting several left wing rebel groups in El Salvador, which eventually secured many concessions in the post-war peace process including a place as a major political party. Surpsingly, however, alliances among non-state actors have only recently begun to receive much scholarly attention.

@Asal2008 and @Horowitz2013 conduct network analyses of alliance formation among terrorist groups, arguing that such arrangement are used to aggregate capabilities and share tactics. Much of the other work in the field focuses on the downsides of alliance. @Bapat2012 assume that alliances carry two significant costs: the dilution of each constituent group's agenda, and the risk of having one's private information sold to the government by an ally. Consistent with this theory, they find alliances to be most common when an outside state can enforce agreements, and when all rebel groups involved are strong enough to avoid the temptation of defecting to the government side. @Christia2012 similarly emphasizes capability, arguing that neorealist balancing theory from international relations explains alignments in civil wars. When one coalition - a group of rebels or government-aligned forces - becomes too powerful, other groups will band together to prevent their own destruction. But similar to @Bapat2012, @Christia2012 argues that this mechanism is constrained by a desire to maximize one's share of the post-war spoils. Thus, rebels realign frequently, seeking to form minimum winning coalitions. While shared identity appears on the surface to be an important determinant of rebel alignments, Christia views these narratives as post-hoc justifications aimed at legitimizing decisions that are really driven mostly by power.

The existing studies do much to advance our knowledge of relationships between non-state actors. Yet, some important aspects of alliance formation are beyond the scope of the existing studies, however. Namely, while relative power considerations can potentially account for why rebel groups form alliances, and when they will alter their ties, it does not explain why groups choose a particular partner. @Horowitz2013 do shed light on this question, finding that militants prefer to ally with powerful groups, but their focus is largely on transnational networks of terrorists and insurgents, rather than alliance formation within a particular conflict. I offer an explanation of alliance formation that can predict not only when rebel groups will seek alliances, but also with whom. Furthermore, I connect this process to the broader dynamics of rebel movement structure, particularly splintering.

## Previous Work on Repression

As repression is central to the theoretical argument presented here, this dissertation is shaped by and contributes to the literature on the topic. The focus in the existing literature has been on explaining why repression occurs, and identifying factors that might prevent it. @Davenport2007a finds that there is a "domestic democratic peace," meaning that democratic regimes tend to refrain from using the most violent forms of repression. However, he finds that even democracies often engage in repression during civil and international conflicts. Others find that international human rights treaties often have a meaningful restraining effect on governments, reducing their use of repression [@Hathaway2002; @simmons09]. Not all international influences are positive, however, as economic sanctions [@Wood2008a] are associated with increased repression. An important generalization in the context of this study is that human rights practices tend to be shaped by domestic and international political institutions that are likely to be largely exogenous to civil war dynamics.^[Long-running civil wars, however, might deter democratization and participation in human rights treaties.]

Another strand of the repression literature focuses on the consequences of repression, and especially the potential of repression to provoke escalation. In this vein @Lichbach1987 argues that repression should lead dissidents to substitute increasingly violent tactics for more peaceful ones, as they will calculate that violence is more likely to achieve their goals. @Moore1998 finds empirical support for this model, suggesting that repression has significant potential to escalate political confrontations. My findings in Chapter \@ref(survey-chapter) add further support for this model, as I show that repression increases willingness to engage in violence, while decreasing the likelihood that individuals will engage in peaceful political activities such as voting. I also move beyond this debate to show that repression can shape not only the likelihood, but also the structure of civil war violence.

## Previous Work on Ethnic Identification

Ethnic identity is central to the theoretical mechanism in this dissertation, and has long been an area of deep interest to scholars of comparative politics. This work is often predicated on the assumption that identity is dynamic. At a minimum, individuals can choose which of their several social roles to emphasize. For instance, individuals might orient primarily toward an ethnicity, a religion, an occupation, a region, or an ideology, and could potentially alter these choices over time. The majority of the work in this vein has focused on oscillations between ethnic and national identities. Early on this question was explored in discussions of statebuilding. Scholars in this area suggest that external threats such as interstate wars [@Herbst1990; @Tilly1992] or territorial disputes [@Gibler2012] can provide a unifying influence, leading individuals to orient toward national identities and away from subnational ones such as ethnicity. Most other work in the area examines the role of political institutions in incentivizing the use of particular identities [@Posner2005; @Penn2008]. For example, @Eifert2010 find that ethnic identification tends to be strongest just prior to or just after competitive elections, suggesting that individuals interpret politics through an ethnic lens.

A striking feature of this literature is the degree of consensus that ethnic identity is malleable. This perspective is shared by a diverse range of scholars ranging from constructivists [e.g. @Barnett1995] to formal theorists [e.g. @Penn2008], and enjoys strong empirical support [e.g. @Eifert2010; @Gibler2012]. Thus, it provides a strong foundation on which to build my theory. This dissertation also contributes to the ethnic identification in two ways. First, while previous work has suggested that internal conflict might have an opposite effect to external wars, leading to increased ethnic identification [@Kaufmann1996b], no existing work has demonstrated this systematically. My dissertation begins to resolve this gap, as Chapter \@ref(survey-chapter) shows that both repression and the presence of civil wars are associated with heightened levels of ethnic identification. Second, whereas most prior studies examine individual-level ethnic identification in isolation [e.g. @Eifert2010], I connect the phenomenon to aggregate outcomes, namely the formation and restructuring of rebel groups.

## Previous Work on Rebel Motives

An examination of the relationships between dissident groups is also likely to offer a new perspective on rebel motives. For the last 15 years, the literature on civil war has largely been dominated by debates over whether rebellion is fundamentally political, or done in pursuit of private benefits. The former views civil war as an effort to resolve economic or political inequality [@gurr70; @Wood2003; @Cederman2010], and has been labeled as the 'grievance' hypothesis [@Collier2004]. The latter is composed primarily of studies emphasizing the 'greed' hypothesis [@Collier2004], which view rebellion as little more than large-scale criminal activity aimed at bringing profits to its members [@mueller00; @Lujala2005; @Ross2004e]. Others have emphasized non-material private benefits as motive for individual participation in rebellion, such as the ability to act on family disputes or romantic rivalries [@Kalyvas2006].

This political-private motive debate has yet to be definitively resolved. A number of scholars have found greater support for the greed hypothesis than for grievance, with the presence of natural resources being a stronger predictor of civil war than economic or political grievances [@Collier2004]. Yet, these findings are not robust across different types of resources or even different measures of the same resource [@Dixon2009a]. Furthermore, several scholars have found that political factors such as hierarchical relationships between ethnic groups [@Cederman2010] and poor economic performance [@Miguel2004a] exert a strong influence on civil war onset. Other scholars eschew the dichotomy altogether, suggesting that while private benefits are useful to rebel recruiting efforts, this does not preclude the possibility that rebel elites ultimately have political motives [@Lichbach1995; @Weinstein2007]. Similarly, @Lujala2010 finds that natural resources are associated with longer conflicts, implying that at least a portion of resource revenues are devoted to fighting rather than private benefits.

One factor that has limited progress on these questions of motive is the fact that the competing theories have been tested almost exclusively on a single outcome --- a binary measure of the occurrence of civil war at the national level. Studying the relationships between dissident groups and how they vary is likely to provide insight to underlying rebel motives. For instance, if rebellion is fundamentally about maximizing the profits of its members, the structure of rebel movements should be shaped largely by the natural resources present in a country. As many of the extraction of many of the resources thought to be associated with rebellion is not particularly labor-intensive (for instance, the extraction of alluvial diamonds from river beds), rebels should prefer to keep their groups small so as to maximize the share of profits given to each individual member. In resource-rich areas, we should see highly fragmented rebel movements. Furthermore, the use of violence in such a scenario is likely to be aimed at acquiring and defending access to resources, and if anything is more likely if other groups have adopted violent tactics. If rebellion is a political enterprise, by contrast, there should be possibilities for coalition building and cooperation between rebels, as the primary concern is maximizing the likelihood of defeating the government. Yet, there is also a possibility for free riding, suggesting the decision to resort to violence is interdependent in the direction of becoming less likely as other groups mobilize.
