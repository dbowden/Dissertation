# Conclusion Outline

- 1 para summary for each hypothesis
- Implications:
    + Shows that there is a sectarian spiral. This is consistent with Lewis (2016) - ethnicity not necessarily important to initial organization of rebellion, but is important to survival.
    + Fragmentation of rebel movements reflects fragmentation of society
        * In turn this shows that rebels are political, surprisingly representative of societal preferences
    + Government can have a significant influence on structure of rebel movements
    + Policymakers: further reason to care about repression
    + Protecting civilians may limit conflict complexity
- Future work:
    + Why does government do this? What is their preference re: rebel structure?
    + Other processes - external intervention, peacekeeping, regime defection
    + More focus on rebel elites and content of their platforms
    + Does form of repression - degree to which it is targeted on ethnic basis - matter
- Further policy questions:
    + How to undo the spiral? The classic method of statebuilding is external war.
