## The Shan Secessionist Movement

The Shan State secessionist movement in Burma includes cases that support both the splintering and alliance formation aspects of the analysis. Yet it has also seen many instances of splintering that my theory would not predict, suggesting additional variables for consideration. Shan State is a large, mountainous area in eastern Burma, bordering Thailand on the south, Laos on the east, and China on the north. The Shan people and language are both closely related to the Thai, and in pursuit of its historical rivalry with Burma the Thai government has frequently supported Shan rebellions to form a sort of buffer zone between the two countries [@Steinberg2010]. Adding to the international character of the region are the facts that it has long been one of the world's most productive areas for opium cultivation, and that it was used as refuge by Kuomintang (KMT) forces fleeing China in the 1950's and 1960's [@Cowell2005]. Shan State initially faced less repression than most other areas of the country, as it had been granted the right to secede in the Burmese Constitution [@Silverstein1958].

The initial formation of rebellion in Shan State is largely consistent with the process of group formation I discuss in Chapter \@ref(entry), although there was not an ongoing conflict in the region. Following their defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1950, a contingent of KMT soldiers fled into Shan in search of refuge. During the same period, the Communist Party of Burma and separatists from the Kachin region frequently used the area as a base of operations [@Smith1999]. In hopes of defeating the Communists and Kachin, and expelling the KMT, the Burmese army sent a large troop deployment to the region in the late 1950's. These forces were undisciplined, however, and frequently committed abuses against the local population. These abuses induced a greater level of Shan nationalism as a basis for opposition to the occupation [@Fredholm1993, Ch. 8]. The process of increased ethnic identification in this case is largely consistent with my theoretical argument. Shan elites, especially the leaders of student organizations, began developing and advocating for a distinctly Shan identity in the mid-1950's. Repression by the Burmese army significantly enhanced the efficacy of these appeals, leading large portions of the Shan to embrace ethnic nationalism [@Fredholm1993, 156--157]. In 1958 this nationalism culminated in the formation of the first Shan rebel group, the Young Brave Warriors.

Shortly after the fighting began, the Young Brave Warriors splintered. A large portion of the group's membership joined the new Shan State Independence Army (SSIA). One factor in this move appears to be the fact that the SSIA was more explicitly nationalist than its predecessor [@Brown1988a; @Fredholm1993, 156]. While I expect ethnically-homogeneous groups such as the Young Brave Warriors to be more cohesive than multi-ethnic coalitions, these groups are still vulnerable to outbidding appeals. The Young Brave Warriors-SSIA split is consistent with my general argument that repression induces greater levels of ethnic identification, which in turn leads rebels to reorganize. It also suggests an explanation for my finding of no relationship between the ethnic composition of a rebel group and its risk of splintering --- even ethnically-homogeneous groups are at risk of splintering through an outbidding dynamic. Thus it may be the case that the null finding is the result not of multi-ethnic groups being cohesive, but rather of mono-ethnic groups being similarly fragile.

The Shan secessionist movement has also seen the creation of several alliances. Almost immediately upon splitting from the Young Brave Warriors, the students who from the SSIA welcomed a group of defectors from the Burmese Army [@Fredholm1993, 156]. In 1964, the SSIA participated in a much larger merger with the Kokang Force and the Shan National United Front, forming the Shan State Army (SSA) [@Lintner1984]. While the Kokang are often considered a separate ethnic group from the Shan, in my data they are coded as having no ties to an ethnic group. With the other two members being Shan, the SSA is coded as an instance of a new mono-ethnic alliance. Collectively, the various Shan organizations totaled no more than 8,000 members [@Fredholm1993, 158]. Thus aggregating and coordinating capabilities was likely an important motive for the group leaders. The timing of the merger is also consistent with my theory. Burma's democratic regime fell to a military coup in 1962, two years prior to the formation of the SSA. While the Latent Human Protection Scores do not detect a sharp change perhaps due to a dearth of data sources in that period, the tactics used by the new military regime toward the various separatists were generally harsher than those of the previous regime [@Charney2009].

While the early years of the Shan independence movement provide strong support for my theory, the amount of subsequent splintering observed there surpasses what I would expect in an ethnically-homogenous movement. My data show that four distinct splinter organizations have appeared in the Shan conflict, and there were a number of other splinter organizations that did not produce enough fatalities to be included in the data [see @Fredholm1993]. This contrasts with the Arakanese Buddhist movement discussed in Chapter \@ref(entry), which never produced a splinter organization. Shan and Arakan are similar on many dimensions. Each is a mountainous region on the country's border, each is pursuing independence for a defined territory that largely maps to historical boundaries, and each is fighting the same Burmese government. That leaves two key differences. First, the Arakan separatist movement had its roots in the efforts to defeat the Japanese occupation during World War II, meaning that most of the dissident elites in the region were at one time members of the same political organization (the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League [AFPFL]). These dissidents then launched a secessionist campaign almost simultaneously with Burmese independence. By contrast, elites in Shan state had been negotiating a peaceful path to independence during British rule, and were granted the right to pursue autonomy in the Burmese constitution [@Charney2009]. Only after it became clear that the Burmese government would not allow a peaceful move toward independence in a timely fashion did the Shan rebel. As this occurred more than ten years after Burmese independence, the Shan dissident elite mostly lacked an existing social network. @Staniland2014 views pre-war social networks as the key to subsequent cohesion. Organizations that have strong ties both between elites and rank-and-file, and between different horizontally equal units should tend to avoid splintering, while others should be plagued by it. It is not clear, however, that the AFPFL meets this criteria. @Steinberg2010 describes it as a loose collection of political organizations and strong men unified only by their opposition to foreign occupation and left-of-center political views.

The second key difference between Shan and Arakan is the robust drug trade in the former. A major reason why the KMT selected Shan State as a base of operations was the opportunity to reap profits from the opium trade [@Cowell2005]. After the KMT was forced out of the region, Shan rebels largely filled this role. The emergence of at least one of the splinter organizations in the conflict is clearly related to the drug trade. The Shan United Revolutionary Army split from the SSA to focus on controlling drug production, rather than political goals. While I include a measure of lootable resources in my quantitative analyses which is not significant, the Shan case suggests that under certain conditions resources can provoke splintering.
