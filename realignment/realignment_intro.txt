Having explored the formation of new rebel groups in the previous chapter, I turn now to the other major process affecting the number of rebel groups in a conflict --- the realignment of existing rebel factions. There are two ways in which rebels can realign. First, subsets of existing groups can break away to form splinter organizations. For example, Hezbollah split from the Amal movement during the Lebanese Civil War to form a more radical organization. I define a splinter organization as an independent rebel group, signified by having an identifiable name and leadership that are not shared with any other rebel group, that was previously subsumed within another rebel organization. Thus, entirely new rebel groups are excluded, even if they constitute a subset of a larger non-violent organization. Splinter organizations generally emerge during ongoing conflicts, though sometimes they are formed during periods of peace to initiate a new wave of fighting, as the Real Irish Republican Army did [@Stedman1997].

Second, previously independent rebel organizations can form alliances. Here I focus on alliances with meaningful integration of command structures, defining an alliance as an organization with a distinct name that merges a substantial amount of the decision-making for two or more previously independent rebel groups. This might occur if one group absorbs another, or two groups create a formal umbrella organization to coordinate their activities. An example of the latter case is the Syrian Defense Forces, under which the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) have joined with several Arab rebel groups to coordinate their campaign against the Islamic State. Note that this definition excludes cooperation that falls short of formal integration. Such behavior is difficult to measure systematically in any case, though multiple forthcoming data collections should facilitate research on the topic in the future.

I expect these process to be closely related as part of a broader process of realignment around ethnic identity. Repression should make civilians more likely to identify with their ethnic group. While I do not necessarily expect this effect to extend directly to rebels --- almost by definition, they experience violence --- I do expect that there will generally be a strong connection between rebels and civilians dissidents. Except for a few cases with exceptionally large endowments of natural resources or foreign support, rebels depend on dissident civilians for recruits, shelter, and material resources. As civilians often have the ability to defect to the side of a rival rebel group or the government, rebels have an incentive to represent the interests and identities of these constituents. Furthermore, ethnic identification can be an effective means of securing support from foreign co-ethnic states, and such appeals might be especially likely to succeed during periods of repression. Thus, rebels should tend to identify more strongly with their ethnic group following episodes of repression.

This dynamic should lead rebels to reorganize on the basis of ethnicity. In some cases rebel leaders may be able to reorient their group to emphasize ethnicity more strongly [see @Christia2012]. Often, however, it will be difficult for them to do so credibly. For example, if a rebel had previously maintained a multi-ethnic coalition of support, it would be difficult for them to emphasize a particular ethnic identity. In such cases, entrepreneurial members of the group may see opportunities to form a new splinter organization that "outbids" the original rebel group with a more credible, extreme appeal to ethnic identity [see @horowitz85]. As doing so could potentially win the support of a large number of dissident civilians, and leading a rebel group is likely to bring private benefits such as resource revenues, this should often be an enticing opportunity. As I expect this cycle of ethnic outbidding to be especially likely in the wake of repression, I expect that the level of repression should predict the likelihood that new splinter organizations will form.

*Hypothesis 6: The probability that rebels groups splinter should increase with the level of repression in a country*

I argue that splintering often reflects a process of reorganization around ethnic identity. The ability of this process to produce new rebel groups should depend, however, on the pre-existing configuration. A rebel group that is already composed primarily of members of a single ethnicity may be able to adapt to increased ethnic identification, though they may still fragment as a result of outbidding appeals. Nevertheless, groups that draw their support from multiple ethnic groups should be much more vulnerable to fragmentation as the result of increased ethnic identification.

*Hypothesis 7: Multi-ethnic rebel groups should be at greater risk of splintering than mono-ethnic ones*

My theory also suggests a testable implication regarding the characteristics of the splinters groups that emerge. If splintering is motivated by a desire to form rebel groups that more clearly represent a particular ethnic group, the rebel groups that emerge from this process should be likelier than others to draw their support from a single ethnic group.

*Hypothesis 8: Splinter organizations should be more likely than others to draw their support from a single ethnic group*

While this process of realignment around ethnic identities should lead to the fragmentation of some groups, in other cases it might create opportunities for aggregation. One disadvantage of splintering is that it will generally result in a weaker organization than members had previously, as it will have only a subset of the parent group's members at its disposal. As a crucial function of alliances is the aggregation of capabilities, forming new alliances is a potential solution to this problem. Alliances may also have the benefit of managing potential conflict between their members [@Gibler1996], ensuring that resources are directed toward fighting the government rather than other rebel groups. Finally, outside states often attempt to maximize the impact of their support by channeling it to a coalition of rebels, rather than a series of smaller, independent groups. Interventions of this sort might be especially likely in the wake of a humanitarian crisis.

As is the case with splintering, my theory offers predictions regarding not only when new alliances should emerge, but also what their ethnic composition should be. I expect that the ethnic polarization sparked by repression should lead rebels to leave multi-ethnic coalitions, but also to form new alliances with co-ethnic factions.

*Hypothesis 9: The probability that new mono-ethnic alliances will form should increase with the level of repression*

Conversely, the emergence of multi-ethnic alliances should be less likely when this dynamic is at work.

*Hypothesis 10: The probability that new multi-ethnic alliances will form should decrease with the level of repression*

I proceed with an explanation for a research design for these four hypotheses. After presenting the findings, I assess the effect of repression on the total number of rebel groups.
