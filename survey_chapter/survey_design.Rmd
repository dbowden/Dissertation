## Research Design

### The Afrobarometer Survey

To examine the relationship between repression and individual attitudes toward political participation and ethnic identities, I use waves 3-6^[The ethnic vs. national identity question was not asked in waves 1 and 2.] of the Afrobarometer survey. The Afrobarometer is administered by researchers at Michigan State University, the Institute for Democracy in South Africa, and the Center for Democratic Development in Ghana. In each wave the survey attempts to obtain a nationally-representative sample of 20-25 African countries. This is accomplished by randomly sampling geographic areas (villages, neighborhoods, etc), with selection probabilities weighted by population. Within each geographic area a starting point is chosen at random, from which interviews begin randomly selecting households. Individuals are then randomly selected within households, alternating between men and women to ensure gender balance. The sample in each country usually numbers either 1,200 or 2,400, depending on the size and diversity of the country. Respondents are asked over 300 questions on their demographics and background, and their opinions on a wide range of political and cultural questions. One advantage of using such a general survey is the relatively low likelihood that individuals will be primed to answer questions about ethnicity in a way that is not representative of their normal opinions [@Eifert2010].

Attributes for each survey wave are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:afro-topline). The four waves span the period 2005--2016, cover 38 countries, and collect a total of 158,362 individual responses. Response rates are generally quite high, averaging 76.5% in wave 6, and 77.7% in wave 5. A detailed summary of included countries is provided in Table \@ref(tab:response) of the Appendix.

Wave  | Years  | Total Responses  | Countries
--|---|---|--
 3 | 2005 | 25,397 | 18
 4 | 2008 | 27,713 | 20
 5 | 2011--2013 | 51,587 | 34
 6 | 2016 | 53,935 | 36
 Total | 2005--2016 | 158,362 | 36

One concern relevant to the present application is that in rare cases the Afrobarometer excludes geographic areas experiencing significant violence or other factors that would pose a danger to interviewers. Additionally, questions about ethnic identity are not asked in some countries where doing so is deemed to be potentially harmful to the sampled communities. Each of these attributes is suboptimal, but I argue that each introduces bias *against* my hypotheses, rather than for them. I expect that repression will induce individuals to be more willing to engage in violent mobilization, and more likely to identify with their ethnic group. By excluding areas experiencing high levels of violence, the sample is likely to exclude many of the areas experiencing the highest levels of repression. Thus, my hypotheses face a hard test --- I must find an effect for repression in a sample where repression levels are mostly low or moderate.

### Dependent Variables

#### Ethnic Identity {-}

The first dependent variable explored in this chapter is *ethnic identification*. The Afrobarometer asks individuals about the extent to which they identify with their ethnic group, relative to their nation. The question text is as follows:

>"Let us suppose that you had to choose between being a [ENTER NATIONALITY] and being a ________ [Respondentâ€™s Ethnic Group]. Which of the following best expresses your feelings?"

Respondents place themselves on a five point scale with the possible responses: "I feel only [ethnicity]", "I feel more [ethnicity] than [nationality]", "I feel equally [ethnicity] and [nationality]", "I feel more [nationality] than [ethnicity]", and "I feel only [nationality]". In most models I collapse the measure into a binary variable, with respondents in the first two categories coded as ethnic identifiers, and all others as non-ethnic identifiers.

Individuals self-report their ethnicity earlier in the survey. The question is open-ended, allowing for the possibility that respondents may conceive of ethnicity in ways that do not comport with scholarly definitions. Indeed, around 1.5% of respondents provide answers such as "African" or the name of a sub-national region. The vast majority, however, choose ethnicities that appear in externally-imposed classifications, such as the Ethnic Power Relations data [@Vogt2015].

```{r ethnic}
library(xtable)
library(sjmisc)
load("/Users/david/Dropbox/Dissertation/Document/survey_chapter/survey_data/merged_afrobarometer.Rds") #built by afrobarometer_dataprep.R
options(xtable.comment = FALSE)
tab <- table(to_label(afro$eth_id))
tab2 <- cbind(tab, prop.table(tab)*100)
colnames(tab2) <- c("Count", "Percentage")
xtable(tab2, digits=c(0,0,1), caption="Summary of Ethnic Identification (waves 3-6)", label="tab:ethnic")
```

Relatively few respondents identify with their ethnic group, with 4.3% answering that they feel only an ethnic identity, and 7.4% saying that their ethnic identity was more prevalent than their national identity (see Table \@ref(tab:ethnic)). A plurality of respondents (35.8%) said that they felt equally attached to their national and ethnic identities, and a large percentage (34.1%) said that they feel only a national identity.


#### Political Participation {-}

Additionally, I examine the effects of repression on various forms of political participation, including voting[^vote], attending community meetings[^participation], protesting, and participating in violence. I collapse each variable into binary categories with individuals who engaged in the activity at least once coded as one, and individuals who did not participate in the activity for any reason coded as zero.



Each of these measures is self-reported, and not subject to any independent verification. It is well-established in the US context that self-reported surveys overestimate the prevalence of voting, introducing bias to models of political participation [@Bernstein2001]. It is unclear whether such effects are prevalent in Africa. 70.4% of respondents in the full sample reported voting, though the number varies wildly across countries in a manner that generally matches variation in actual voter turnout [see @Kuenzi2007]. While social desirability bias might lead some individuals to claim they have voted while in fact they have not, the effect is likely to be in the opposite direction for less desirable behaviors such as protesting and violence. These effects are most likely to introduce bias into my analysis if individuals misreport behavior on both the independent in dependent variables. For example, if individual falsely claimed both to have been attacked and engaged in violence themselves, they would contribute to the relationship between those variables being overstated.

### Independent Variables

*H1* predicts that individuals who experience violent repression should be more likely to participate in violence than others, and *H2* predicts that repression should increase the extent that individuals identify with their ethnic group. I test these propositions using both individual-level and national-level measures of repression. At the individual level, I use an Afrobarometer question that asks respondents whether they or a family member has been attacked in the past year:

>"During the past year, have you or anyone in your family: Been physically attacked?"

The possible responses are: "no," "once," "twice," "three or more times," and "don't know." This question has two noteworthy limitations. First, it does not differentiate between individuals who were personally attacked from family members of people who were attacked. However, I expect that this feature is more likely to introduce bias against my hypotheses, than in their favor. The effect of violence on family members of people who are attacked should be less than or equal to that on people who personally experience violence. If this assumption holds, including family members should either have no effect or understate the effect of being attacked. Second, the question does not identify the source of the attack. While government repression may account for some attacks, the measure likely also includes violence from non-state actors including rebel groups, as well as common criminal activity. Again, however, I expect this to create bias against my hypotheses. Attacks that clearly should not be characterized as repression, such as domestic violence, should be less likely to influence willingness to engage and violence or identify with an ethnic group. Thus, including these types of attacks in the measure is more likely to understate the effect of repression than overstate it.

At the country level, I employ I use the Latent Human Protection Scores, version 2 [@Fariss2014; @Schnakenberg2014]. This data uses a Bayesian measurement model to estimate latent human rights scores using several data sources including US State Department and Amnesty International country reports, and several scholarly datasets on repression and mass killing. This data improves on previous approaches to measuring human rights by accounting for the fact that the standards by government and NGO reports have judged countries have generally improved over time. The result is an aggregate measure that ranges from roughly -3 (most repressive) to 3 (most respectful of human rights).

### Control Variables

I draw on previous studies of ethnic identity to identify a set of relevant control variables [@Eifert2010; @Gibler2012; @Masella2013; @Robinson2014]. Each of these measures comes from the Afrobarometer, though some are not included in all waves. These include the respondent's gender and age, a binary indicator of whether they are employed at least part-time, whether they reside in an urban area, and whether they support the ruling party. I have examined several other controls, but exclude them from the models reported here as they are neither statistically significant nor do they alter the performance of my variables of interest. These include a binary indicator for individuals who work in agriculture (farming and fishing), an index of the level of economic development in the respondent's community, and the size of the respondent's ethnic group.

At the country level I control for ethnolinguistic fractionalization as both a linear and quadratic effect, using data from @fearonlaitin03. Additionally, I include the country's Polity IV regime score [@Marshall2016], and indicators of whether the country had a separatist war or civil war over the central government during the year the respondent was interviewed, constructed from the Uppsala Conflict Data [@Melander2016].

### The Model

As I am interested in the effects of variables measured at both the individual and country levels, a multilevel model is the appropriate method of analysis. I begin with a relatively simple model with random intercepts for each country.

The intuition behind this model is that the baseline values for each dependent variable vary by country, while the independent variables have a consistent effect in each country. For example, the baseline probability of ethnic identification might vary from country to country, but the model assumes that the effect of repression will be the same in each country. Later in the chapter I relax this assumption by allowing the coefficients for my independent variables to vary by country. For robustness, I estimate more complex models with random intercepts for each ethnic group nested within each country, and with random intercepts for each survey wave.

[^vote]: Question text: "Understanding that some people were unable to vote in the most recent national election in [20xx], which of the following statements is true for you?" 0= You were not registered to vote, 1= You voted in the elections, 2= You decided not to vote, 3=You could not find the polling station, 4=You were prevented from voting, 5= You did not have time to vote, 6= You did not vote because you could not find your name in the voters' register, 7= Did not vote for some other reason, 8= You were too young to vote, 9= Don't Know/ Can't Remember

[^participation]: The meeting, protest, and violence questions share a common stub. Question text: "Here is a list of actions that people sometimes take as citizens when they are dissatisfied with government performance. For each of these, please tell me whether you, personally, have done any of these things during the past year. If not, would you do this if you had the chance: Participated in a demonstration or protest march / Attended a community meeting / Used force or violence for a political cause." Possible responses: : 0=No, would never do this, 1=No, but would do if had the chance, 2=Yes, once or twice, 3=Yes, several times, 4=Yes, often, 9=Donâ€™t know, 98=Refused to answer, -1=Missing
