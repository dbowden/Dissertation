## Introduction

- 45% of civil wars have multiple rebel groups
- Syria, Chad, and Burma have/had 25+ groups

![Syrian Rebel Groups](/Users/david/Dropbox/Dissertation/Document/entry_chapter/syria.jpg)

## Introduction

- Presence of multiple rebel groups associated with: 
    - 35% more fatalities
    - 59% lower probability of peace agreement (Cunningham et al. 2009)
    - Many cases of renewed fighting between former rebel factions (Atlas & Licklider 1999; Zeigler 2016)


- Why do new rebel groups join ongoing civil wars?

## Assumptions

- Rebels are drawn from a larger pool of dissidents
- Some participate in violence from day 1
- Some initially choose less violent opposition strategies, but are willing to resort to violence

## The Pathway to Joining

- Entry of new groups requires change in cost/benefit calculation
    - People who previously decided it was not in their interest to fight must change their mind
- Entry also requires division w/ other dissidents
    - People who decide to mobilize must decide to create a new group rather than joining an existing one
        
## Costs and Benefits

- Benefits of fighting can increase during conflict
- Costs of non-violence can also increase
    - If non-violent people are at risk of physical harm, free riding isn't very free (Kalyvas and Kocher 2007)
    - As risk associated with non-violence approaches risk associated with participation in violence, relative cost of fighting decreases
    - Repression of civilians should increase number of violent dissidents
    
    
## Divisions Among Dissidents

- Individuals have many potential identities, and choose which to emphasize for instrumental reasons (Posner 2005, Penn 2008)
- Repression can influence identity choice
- Indiscriminate repression might activate broad, inclusive identities
    - Unified dissident movement
- Discriminatory repression activates identities that are basis for repression (ethnicity, religion)
    - More divided dissident movement
        
## Hypotheses

- Hypothesis 1: The number of rebel groups in a country should increase with the level of repression
- Hypothesis 2: The number of rebel groups should increase with the extent to which repression is targeted
- Hypothesis 3: There should be a positive interaction between repression and discrimination

## Research Design

- Case selection: country civil war-years, 1946-2015 (Uppsala Conflict Data Program)
- DV: Entry of new rebel groups
- 211/1501 cases

## IV 1: Repression

- Latent Human Protection Scores (Schnakenberg and Fariss 2014, Fariss 2014)
- Uses Bayesian Item Response Model to estimate latent respect for human rights in each country, 1946-2015
- Based on 13 human rights, repression, and mass killing datasets
- Ranges from roughly -3 (most repressive) to +3 (most respectful of human rights)

<!-- Min | Median | Mean | Max -->
<!-- ----|--------|------|---- -->
<!-- -3.1 | -1.4 | -1.2 | 1.5 -->


## IV 2: Targeted Discrimination

- Ethnic Power Relations data (Vogt et al. 2015)
- Each politically-relevant ethnic group coded by access to power
- % of population *not* experiencing discrimination
- Higher values (fewer people facing discrimination) = more targeted discrimination
- 100% recoded to 0


## Research Design

- Controls: conflict intensity, ethnolinguistic fractionalization, population, GDPpc, contiguous civil wars
- Not Shown: Polity, mountainous terrain, oil revenues, strength of largest rebel group, centralization of largest rebel group, external support for rebels, secessionist/non-secessionist
- Model: Logistic regression w/ fixed effects for country
- Robustness: clustered standard errors, rare-events correction

## Summary

- Repression associated with a large, statistically significant increase in number of rebel groups
- Discrimination associated with smaller, but also significant increase
- Interaction of repression and discrimination not significant

## Conclusion

- Repression mobilizes new rebels
- The government can play an important role in shaping structure of rebel movements
- Methodological improvements: better measure of targeted repression, instrument
- Future work: individual-level analysis, government strategy, relationship between original and joining rebel groups
