# Repression

## Schnakenberg and Fariss

- Repression levels vary across time and space, but hard to accurately measure across contexts
- Their model:
    - Accounts for variation in level information contained within human rights indicators
    - Represents uncertainty with credibility intervals
    - Represents temporal dependence
    
- Uses underlying data rather than additive scale of CIRI
