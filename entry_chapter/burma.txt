## Burma Case Study

One set of cases that is likely to provide useful evidence are the separatist movements of Burma. 11 different groups have attempted to secede since the country became independent in 1948. Comparing separatist movements in the same country has the advantage of holding several factors constant. These groups have similar goals (aside from the specific territory involved), they are fighting against the same government, they share similar colonial histories, and they have been active in roughly the same time periods. Yet, they show significant variation on the dependent variable, with some movements such as the Kokang and Karenni producing a single violent group, while the Arakan movement has been represented by seven violent groups, and the Shan by eleven. There is also significant variation on potential explanatory factors. Some of these groups are homogenous on many dimensions, while contain religious or linguistic divisions. Some groups have relationships with outside states or the country's communist insurgency, while others are isolated. There is variation in institutional structure as well, with some movements having robust political wings that engage in local governance, while other are comprised only of violent groups.
