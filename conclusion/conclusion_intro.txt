Why do some conflicts have multiple rebel groups, while in other cases dissidents form a single, cohesive group? As I discuss in Chapter \@ref(intro), the importance of this question has been well established. Civil wars with multiple rebel groups last longer than others [@Cunningham2006; @Akcinaroglu2012], are less likely to end in a peace agreement [@Cunningham2009], have more bases on which conflict could recur [@Atlas1999], and produce more fatalities. In short, civil wars with multiple rebel groups tend to be among the most severe conflicts. Yet we know little about the causes of such structures. No existing work addresses the formation of new rebel groups during conflicts, and existing work on the splintering and merging of existing rebel groups produces somewhat contradictory findings (see for example Christia's [-@Christia2012] focus on power versus Staniland's [-@Staniland2014] emphasis on social structure). My dissertation seeks to fill this gap in the literature.

In Chapter \@ref(theory) I articulate a theory of rebel movement politics that can explain the configuration of rebel groups.
